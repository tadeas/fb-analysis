# Thématic

Social media tend to be very noisy. It can be difficult to see what themes 
generate most engagement on larger Facebook pages.

Thématic detects what major topics a page talks about. It analyzes which 
result in the most and least engagement and which should the page focus on.

Thématic uses Machine Learning on data obtained from the Facebook Graph API.
It then runs some elementary statistics on it, giving us some surprisingly 
useful insights into what the fans do and don't like.
