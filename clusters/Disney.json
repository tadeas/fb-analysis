Comprised of habitat neighborhoods like ritzy Sahara Square and frigid Tundratown, it's a melting pot where animals from every environment live together\u2014a place where no matter what you are, from the biggest elephant to the smallest shrew, you can be anything. But when optimistic Officer Judy Hopps arrives, she discovers that being the first bunny on a police force of big, tough animals isn't so easy. Determined to prove herself, she jumps at the opportunity to crack a case, even if it means partnering with a fast-talking, scam-artist fox, Nick Wilde, to solve the mystery. Walt Disney Animation Studios' \"Zootopia,\" a comedy-adventure directed by Byron Howard (\"Tangled,\" \"Bolt\") and Rich Moore (\"Wreck-It Ralph,\" \"The Simpsons\") and co-directed by Jared Bush (\"Penn Zero: Part-Time Hero\"), opens in theaters on March 4, 2016.
