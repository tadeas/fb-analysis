So as you may have noticed (especially if you watched the DVD) this new AYREON album features a lot of true magician-ship (Troy), keyboard wizardry (Jordan), obedient high-fiving (Hoshi) and other Jedi mind-tricks (myself)... But there's another person who has been pulling a lot of strings on this record from the shadows of his black Tower Studio, sorcering the dark arts of mastering and audio manipulation; my good friend the dark Lord Brett Caldas-Lima. Although I'm back to pretty much hating his bald guts again (I guess his Sith mastery over my mind is slowly starting to faint), I reckon that I truly felt very safe in his expert hands during the last stages of the mixing and mastering phases and believe he well deserved a big shout-out.

Daniel Heiman, a Swedish singer, known for lending his voice to two Lost Horizon albums, is just one of the best voices here on earth. He can sing as high as Michael Mills, but with another tone, a more dramatical one (what does not mean he is better than Michael, who could, anyway?). The song is a little bit cheesy at the beginning, but if you have the time, please listen to it as a whole. Especially the ending is wonderful. I hope you enjoy! :D  .
