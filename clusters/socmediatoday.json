For example, if someone searches for \u201cphotos of software engineers at Facebook\u201d, results will only include users who have made it public knowledge that they\u2019re software engineers at Facebook. Otherwise, they won\u2019t appear.\n\nIn addition, Facebook has partnered with Bing to complement search results with results from the Web. Bing appears to provide web results when the Graph Search needs a boost.\n\nZuckerberg said, \u201cTomorrow we are going focus on Mobile, all languages, posts and open graph,\u201d but today would only be a \u201climited beta\u201d and would be \u201crolling out very slowly.\u201d He also didn\u2019t rule out eventually working with Google, saying \u201cI would love to work with Google, but we have not been able to work something out with [them].\u201d",

Register for the free webinar to learn how to strategically plan for real-time #marketing opportunities from MasterCard, Cabela's and Spredfast. Transform Everyday Events into Meaningful Experiences: Lessons in Real-Time Marketing The FIFA World Cup was the winning topic for many marketers this summer. Big brands, B2B and B2C alike, jumped on the real-time marketing bandwagon. Who could resist the opportunity to engage with the 3.6 billion people watching the games? Before that, this year\u2019s Super Bowl was a big inspiration for marketing in the moment.\n\nWhile customers are more distracted than ever, the only things to capture their focus are the virtues of the present: relevance of time, message, and personal value. However, global public sporting events don\u2019t happen every day. Neither do national holidays. Building awareness, preference, and brand-consumer relationships takes an everyday focus on real-time relevancy. Brands that listen to consumers in their day-to-day lives, tap into their mindset, and engage with response-driven conversations, strengthen customer relationships, and build brand loyalty and purchasing power. \n\nYou don\u2019t want to fall behind in the engagement competition.

Millions tweeted, instagrammed and posted their thoughts, concerns and pictures to Facebook. Topsy estimated that over three and a half million tweets were sent in the 24 hours during and after the storm. Social networks became lifelines for people in need of help or information, and outlets for those eager to share their dramatic stories. Among many other things, Sandy represents the latest demonstration of social media's crucial role in distributing real-time information during major news stories\n\nSandy's other important media impact was to bring climate change back to the forefront of public discussion. While climate received scant attention in the political campaigns of this year, it was almost immediately after the storm hit New York City that Mayor Bloomberg endorsed President Obama, citing climate change. With Sandy serving as reminder of the urgency of climate change and the power of social media, Social Media Today and The Energy Collective have teamed up to tackle questions such as: \n\n -What impact is social media having on how we learn and engage with these natural disasters?\n - Can social media affect the public policy discussion around climate change? Has it?\n -How much did Sandy change the conversation about climate change? Will climate change now be back on the national agenda?\n -How can social media be leveraged to increase its usefulness in times of natural disasters?\n\nRegister here: http://bit.ly/Sv8iNq",

How to Measure Online Influence that Makes a Difference An exclusive, live webinar from Social Media Today and Wildfire\nSeptember 18th at 12pm EST / 9am PST\nRegister here: http://bit.ly/Nl79SA\n\nThe nature of social media is that it's driven by the behavior of consumers, whose decisions are in turn influenced by other people online. There's never been much question that some web users have a stronger or broader influence on people's decisions than others - the challenge for marketers has been to identify these web influencers, and in some cases attempt to influence them in a positive direction as it concerns their business. But how to measure influence, which only works if consumers allow themselves to be swayed?\n\nMeasurement tools have come into being to assign rankings to the influence of an individual, and most social platforms display metrics that purport to describe reach - but does a number of friends or followers aptly illustrate trust, admiration, respect, shared values and the other factors that really make up influence? A large follower number or high influencer score may not indicate meaningful influence over decisions in people's personal or business lives. Or do they?\n\nJoin us http://bit.ly/Nl79SA to discuss the true meaning of web influence and how to measure it:\n\n    What do social technology platforms really measure? \n    Can one be influential without trying to be? \n    Is there a direct correlation between influence and marketing success? \n    How do consumers and marketers decide that someone is influential?\nRegister here: http://bit.ly/Nl79SA",

We're not just talking about Arab Springs and e-commerce, but sustained behavioral change. Our immediate access to boundless information may have extinguished our skills for finding books by the Dewey Decimal System (the What?) but the self-guided knowledge we gain through the Web lights the path to many offline adventures and projects. What we do and absorb online influences the way we eat, make purchase decisions, play, find friends and mates to play with and/or to marry. Because we may usually be tethered to our cellphones, we may not be so aware of how our behaviors have changed when we\u2019re not connected virtually, but this webinar will provide the opportunity to catalog some of those changes. Our panelists and our audience will discuss topics such as:\n    \u2022    How would an anthropologist describe the species-wide changes that have happened because of online activities over the past decade?\n    \u2022    To what extent are we changing consciously and deliberately vs being changed incrementally and insidiously below our level  consciousness?\n    \u2022    What are the trends of change that are happening as connection technologies become more intimate - from the mainframe to the desktop to the laptop to the iPhone and beyond?\n    \u2022    How can we be more conscious of what we are learning and taking positively from the Web, and how we are being conditioned by the Web?",
