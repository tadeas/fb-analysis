For example, if someone searches for \u201cphotos of software engineers at Facebook\u201d, results will only include users who have made it public knowledge that they\u2019re software engineers at Facebook. Otherwise, they won\u2019t appear.\n\nIn addition, Facebook has partnered with Bing to complement search results with results from the Web. Bing appears to provide web results when the Graph Search needs a boost.\n\nZuckerberg said, \u201cTomorrow we are going focus on Mobile, all languages, posts and open graph,\u201d but today would only be a \u201climited beta\u201d and would be \u201crolling out very slowly.\u201d He also didn\u2019t rule out eventually working with Google, saying \u201cI would love to work with Google, but we have not been able to work something out with [them].\u201d",

Protecting Your Brand: The State of Social Infrastructure in The Enterprise Social media has quickly become the face of modern communications for organizations. It\u2019s shifted from a branding, advertising, and research experiment to a rich, core communication channel for sales, recruiting, customer service, and marketing. While the blueprint has changed, few in the business can actually discern exactly what it looks like. That's because social media is an external communications channel. Unlike email and web communications that corporations, and particularly IT teams own and operate, social communications are only managed by marketing.\n\nIn this webinar, expert speakers will explore new research on the Fortune 500's social media accounts, including the accounts, applications, and tools they use to connect and communicate. From this research, other organizations can learn how to create and understand their social blueprint to better coordinate resources, reduce risk, and maximize social ROI. Specifically we\u2019ll discuss:\n\n\u00b7      Social accounts, tools, and technology used by Fortune 500 companies\n\n\u00b7      Understanding your organization\u2019s social communication infrastructure across the entire web\n\n\u00b7      Coordinating social media content review among marketing and legal/risk personnel\n\n\u00b7      Monitoring all brand-affiliated social media accounts for audit, protection, and compliance\n\n\u00b7      Building trust through social media security to maximize your social marketing strategy\u2019s ROI",

Millions tweeted, instagrammed and posted their thoughts, concerns and pictures to Facebook. Topsy estimated that over three and a half million tweets were sent in the 24 hours during and after the storm. Social networks became lifelines for people in need of help or information, and outlets for those eager to share their dramatic stories. Among many other things, Sandy represents the latest demonstration of social media's crucial role in distributing real-time information during major news stories\n\nSandy's other important media impact was to bring climate change back to the forefront of public discussion. While climate received scant attention in the political campaigns of this year, it was almost immediately after the storm hit New York City that Mayor Bloomberg endorsed President Obama, citing climate change. With Sandy serving as reminder of the urgency of climate change and the power of social media, Social Media Today and The Energy Collective have teamed up to tackle questions such as: \n\n -What impact is social media having on how we learn and engage with these natural disasters?\n - Can social media affect the public policy discussion around climate change? Has it?\n -How much did Sandy change the conversation about climate change? Will climate change now be back on the national agenda?\n -How can social media be leveraged to increase its usefulness in times of natural disasters?\n\nRegister here: http://bit.ly/Sv8iNq",

Join our webinar on 12/4 and find out:  Turning Likes Into Loyalty: How to Engage Profitably on Facebook An exclusive, live webinar from Social Media Today and Spredfast\nDecember 4th at 12pm EST / 9am PST\nRegister here: http://bit.ly/Q4cjqc\n\n\nHow can you translate Facebook Likes into valuable assets and customers that deliver real sales? It's been widely observed that even visitors who \"Like\" a company page often never revisit, and large numbers of visitors and Likes don't necessarily translate into leads, sales or even influence. How can your marketing strategy change this dynamic?\n\nThis has become a  classic social media challenge, and strategists have responded by developing community-building practices that can make your Facebook pages \"sticky\" and more active. We've invited a panel of experts to open their bags of tricks and provide ideas and best practices for transforming your company's presence into an effective marketing opportunity. Join us for this webinar to find answers to questions like:\n\n    What incentives attract people back to companies they've Liked on Facebook?\n    What kind of company presence must you build on Facebook to build a loyal following?\n    Is it personality or offers that bring people back to a business page?\n    What community-building activities are most attractive to potential customers?\n\n\n\nRegister here: http://bit.ly/Q4cjqc",

          "Who are the influencers for your brand? Are you leveraging them?  What Does an Influencer Really Look Like? How to Measure Online Influence that Makes a Difference An exclusive, live webinar from Social Media Today and Wildfire\nSeptember 18th at 12pm EST / 9am PST\nRegister here: http://bit.ly/Nl79SA\n\nThe nature of social media is that it's driven by the behavior of consumers, whose decisions are in turn influenced by other people online. There's never been much question that some web users have a stronger or broader influence on people's decisions than others - the challenge for marketers has been to identify these web influencers, and in some cases attempt to influence them in a positive direction as it concerns their business. But how to measure influence, which only works if consumers allow themselves to be swayed?\n\nMeasurement tools have come into being to assign rankings to the influence of an individual, and most social platforms display metrics that purport to describe reach - but does a number of friends or followers aptly illustrate trust, admiration, respect, shared values and the other factors that really make up influence? A large follower number or high influencer score may not indicate meaningful influence over decisions in people's personal or business lives. Or do they?\n\nJoin us http://bit.ly/Nl79SA to discuss the true meaning of web influence and how to measure it:\n\n    What do social technology platforms really measure? \n    Can one be influential without trying to be? \n    Is there a direct correlation between influence and marketing success? \n    How do consumers and marketers decide that someone is influential?\nRegister here: http://bit.ly/Nl79SA",

          "Register for our live webinar tomorrow to find out if Web 2.0 has changed your offline life. (a recording will be available to all who register) http://bit.ly/Kz9qws Can Online Networks Make an Offline Impact? An exclusive, live webinar from Social Media Today\nJune 5th at 12pm EST / 9am PST\nRegister Here: http://bit.ly/Kz9qws\n\nThrough gamification and greater integration with off-line networks, we are entering an era where the activities we create online can have lasting, positive impact in non-wired ways.  We're not just talking about Arab Springs and e-commerce, but sustained behavioral change. Our immediate access to boundless information may have extinguished our skills for finding books by the Dewey Decimal System (the What?) but the self-guided knowledge we gain through the Web lights the path to many offline adventures and projects. What we do and absorb online influences the way we eat, make purchase decisions, play, find friends and mates to play with and/or to marry. Because we may usually be tethered to our cellphones, we may not be so aware of how our behaviors have changed when we\u2019re not connected virtually, but this webinar will provide the opportunity to catalog some of those changes. Our panelists and our audience will discuss topics such as:\n    \u2022    How would an anthropologist describe the species-wide changes that have happened because of online activities over the past decade?\n    \u2022    To what extent are we changing consciously and deliberately vs being changed incrementally and insidiously below our level  consciousness?\n    \u2022    What are the trends of change that are happening as connection technologies become more intimate - from the mainframe to the desktop to the laptop to the iPhone and beyond?\n    \u2022    How can we be more conscious of what we are learning and taking positively from the Web, and how we are being conditioned by the Web?",
