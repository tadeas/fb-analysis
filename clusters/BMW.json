Sam Hurly offers a BMW Story that's the perfect proof: it's about Danny and his son, Boston.\n\nFor Sam Hurly (https://instagram.com/samhurly), the way Danny goes about his passion is constant reminder that having a companion around while working on your car makes a world of difference. Whether they've come to help work, learn, or just simply to share in the conversation, that second person can be both a motivator and a calming presence. One afternoon, when Sam found out that Danny had begun work on his 1985 BMW 528e, he arrived to find - little to his surprise - that business was already in session: family business.\n\nBetween chapters of his studies, Danny's son, Boston received lessons on BMW parts as they were removed from the 30 year old sedan. It's a magical thing, to see a son appear so similar to his father, both in looks and in the joy expressed. And all of this because of their favourite toy. #BMWstories Photos from BMW's post",

My first experience of owning this apparently reliable and well designed German brand is the hood motor failed yesterday due to water collecting in the hood motor. This is due to extremely poor design by BMW as the hood drainage channels become blocked and allow water to collect and flood the hood motor. 10 mins on google and it appears this is a common fault with all Z4 models and costs over \u00a3900 to fix as the hood as to be removed and new hood motor/hydraulic pump fitted. BMW I have never had an issue regarding such poor design with my Alfa Romeos. Why has BMW not recalled this Z4 model to modify the hood drainage channels?",

          "This is my 3 year old BMW 1 series and these are my 11 week old babies Benjamin and Jospeh. On Sunday I was driving on the M25 at 70mph with Ben and Joseph in the car when the brakes suddenly slammed on and I lost control of the vehicle. We were nearly in a high speed collision. The car repeatedly slammed on its brakes as I tried to get out of the fast lane. As you can imagine I was horrified. Drivers around me clearly thought I was trying to deliberately cause an accident. BMW Sytner in Chigwell diagnosed a fault in the car which they say they have never seen before and are apparently sending the parts away for testing. They admit this was a serious incident but think it's ok for me to continue using the vehicle. They are showing a complete lack of concern for mine or the babies safety and are brushing it under the carpet. They even had the cheek to tell me that my tyres are worn (no sh*t Sherlock my car has been trying to emergency stop at 70mph). Has anyone heard of this happening before? Is this really an unheard of fault? Is it unreasonable of me to not want to continue driving the vehicle? I've tried to raise my concerns but they are saying I need to go back to MotorPoint where I bought the car from??",

          "***Disappointed customer let down by BMW***\n\nI am the owner of a BMW 318 (petrol) which is a 61 plate. This vehicle was purchased by Harry fairbairn (BMW), Kirkcaldy, Fife 2 years ago. It was an approved used vehicle with only. 18772 miles on the clock. The car was in complete working order and was exactly how I expected/dreamed my first BMW to be.\n\nHowever after approximately 10-11 months my engine management light come on and the car had to be returned to Harry Fairbairn to be checked over. The fault I believe was a sensor failure in the engine or exhaust area. At first the sensor was cleaned and I was charged for this due to the warranty only covering replacements not cleaning. I was unhappy with this due to the vehicle having very low mileage. I was reassured by the service department that the engine was checked over and there were no concerns.  \nWithin days of receiving my car back the engine management light came on again. The car was then returned to Harry Fairbairn and the sensor was then replaced under warranty and after complaining I was refunded the money for the repair. \n\nAfter this repair my car ran ok up until July 2016 where I started to get a strange mechanical grinding noise coming from the engine.\n\nI took my car to my local garage (D&G Autocare, Dunfermline) and they inspected the engine. They struggled to replicate the noise and they suggested that if it was to get worse I may need to take it back to BMW to have it checked.\n\nUp until January 2017, the vehicle was running fine and only occasionally made the noise when cold. However the noise became more severe and on some occasions the engine management light would come on. However soon as the engine was warm and the car was turned off and then re started the engine management light would turn off.\n\nBeing concern that the noise was getting worse I booked my car into Harry Fairbairn, Kirkcaldy again to get it checked. Whilst booking the car in I was informed that the vehicle was to get a Quality Enhancement on the engine.\n\nThe diagnostic check was carried out and the quality enhancement was completed (again full details held by Harry Fairbairn). I was then informed by the service department that the noise would be coming from the timing chain and that it would need replaced at a cost of \u00a31200.\n\nBeing shocked by this I carried out a search on the internet regarding this fault and was surprised by what I read. I discovered that it was not uncommon that BMW's manufactured between 2006 and 2011 had this fault and that BBC's watchdog actually covered this in 2013. (Link below) In the article the most occurrences were with the N47 diesel engine however it was also being reported in many petrol engines including the model fitted in my car. Further research on the internet showed that many BMW's were recalled in Germany and other countries in Europe apart from the UK. Lastly I read that some customers who's timing chains had snapped and caused severe damage where given a good will gesture from BMW because of the known fault.\n\nConcerned by what I had read I contacted Eastern BMW, Edinburgh to get an independent opinion and explained the circumstances of my car including the condition, mileage etc and told them about my fault. They were shocked to hear what I told them and suggested that I make a claim through yourselves via Harry Fairbairn.\n\nBMW refused informed me that because my vehicle had missed 1 service it would not be covered.\n\nDisappointed by this I contacted a family friend who is the lead mechanic at Peugeot, Dunfermline and asked his opinion on the fault and if a servicing would have stopped the fault occurring. He informed me that a service would not of prevented or even diagnosed the fault due to the timing chain being at the rear of the engine and can only be examined by removing the engine completely. I contacted my local garage D&G and they also confirmed this. They also informed me that they wouldn't expect a timing belt to go at that mileage let alone a timing chain.\n\nI am not normally a person who uses social media how I don't want any other person to have the same experience from me especially when  BMW's customer complaints page on their website states \"BMW is committed to providing products and service of the highest standard\".\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/23p5j5wzPtYflS7kFvmKVZf/bmw-deny-engine-failures-are-due-to-manufacturing-fault\n\nhttp://prestige-german-engines.co.uk/engine-issues/bmw-timing-chain-failure/ Engine Rebuild for BMW N47 & M57 Timing Chain Failure Timing chain repairs on BMW models 118d, 120d, 123d, 318d, 320d, 520d, 525d, 530d, 535d, X3, X5 and 730d - engine code N47 & M57",

Car goes in to be rectified - refused because there was nothing they can do I was told it was a standard acoustic flaw.\n\n2.

Area technician states that there is no issues with the car (describing it as a standard acoustic flaw in this model) which has supposedly been repaired under warranty as there was a problem (which still exists). \n\n4. BMW are unsure of the problem with the car so it then becomes easier to state that the car is in perfect condition and it was designed  to do this. I'm being told it's the waste gate valve and it needs to rattle while it warms up until so it doesn't cause issues with the turbo, yet speaking to independent garages they say it doesn't sound like that, miss diagnostic? \n\nI refuse to believe that a premium car would be designed and developed with an intentional engine rattle and clunking, the noise certainly turns heads in the car park. \nI've asked BMW UK and Knights BMW on a number of occasions the following questions which they refuse to even acknowledge let alone answer;\n1) if this is a standard acoustic flaw why didn't it happen for the first 2 years and 20k miles?\n2) if it is a standard acoustic flaw why does it not happens in all the 116i models? And certainly not any for sale at Knights?\n3) If it was a standard acoustic flaw why would Knights and BMW spend money on replacing the turbo unit? And when this didn't work refused to carry out any more work!!!\n4) why did it not rattle for 2 years if it needed to rattle in order not to cause problems with the turbo?\n5) why when I turn the car off and on again is the rattle gone, the car has not warmed up in a few seconds?\n\nBMW uk have told me there is nothing more they can do refusing to acknowledge the questions above referring me back to Knights who tell me they cannot fix my (un fixable) car  as BMW uk won't approve any work, creating a very annoying loop with no resolution.\n\nThis is disgusting from a so called premium car brand.

I have owned many other cars and Luxury Brands, but nothing has surpassed the engineering and driving pleasure of owning a BMW. Unfortunately my first BMW purchase has been plagued with constant trips to the shop and constant break downs; leaving myself and my loved ones in danger or in constant fear of being without a vehicle. I have remained a fan throughout and despite my job being at risk, and friends constantly reminding me I should have purchased another brand I have remained loyal. My patience wore thin though after the 6th or 7th break down this past weekend. I spoke with corporate for potential resolution in terms of a replacement vehicle or compensation, and they were very responsive and willing to work with me. This also extended to BMW of Denver who have been an absolute Jewel throughout the process. The Corporate compassion and understanding quickly ended when they deemed my vehicle to not be a lemon and working in perfect order this afternoon. My car has been in the shop over 4 times within the first year and over 7 times for the same Drivetrain Malfunction Error; a well known issue plaguing many BMW's and they refuse to assist me any further.

          "Here are all the issues I\u2019ve had since delivery of my new BMW, registration HN65 TKU.\n \nThe vehicle was delivered around 10am Monday 14th December 2015 by a contracted driver who had already driven the vehicle around 160 miles. I was very briefly shown around the vehicle but not properly by any means. When I was asked to sign the paperwork I asked the driver if he was able to show me the specific extras that I had ordered and he was unable to do so indicating the fact that he didn\u2019t work for BMW. So obviously I then had to sign paperwork unaware whether the car actually had the specifications that I had asked for.\n \nI live in a very remote village with the nearest train station being just under 5 miles away. The driver was supposed to make his own way there and as a goodwill gesture I offered to drive him to BMW in Stevenage which was around 13 miles each way.\n \nAround 5pm Monday the new vehicle started smoking and producing a very strong burning smell. As I have never had a BMW before and I had ordered through Neva-Consultants I was unsure as to who I should call. Neva\u2019s offices were closed so I called one of the sales teams' mobile numbers who was actually on holiday. He made me aware of BMW\u2019s emergency service line which I then called.\n\nAfter having to explain the problem and register all my details I was told around 6pm that a mechanic would be no longer than 90 minutes. The mechanic actually turned up around 9.15pm. This whole time I was sat at a family friend\u2019s house with my 2 year old son for over 3 hours. If I hadn\u2019t have been near my friends\u2019 house then I would have been sat with my son on the roadside.\n \nWhen the mechanic arrived I explained to him about the smoke and smell. He basically told me that it was impossible for the smell to be inside the vehicle indicating I was lying and that he couldn\u2019t find a fault.\n\nI then drove the vehicle again and the smoke and smell returned so I took videos of the problem and called the mechanic\u2019s mobile. He showed up again saying that he wasn\u2019t sure what was causing the problem and that I should call the garage in the morning. He wouldn\u2019t fill out a form for me as I had called his mobile the second time and apparently a job wasn\u2019t raised through BMW but he advised me to avoid driving the vehicle.\n \nI then had to get my Father to come and get me and my son and to help get the vehicle back to my home address which was 10 miles away. I didn\u2019t get back to my house until around 11.30pm. I had a full day off work Monday to wait for delivery of this new vehicle and then by Monday evening had no use of a vehicle and had to arrange for my boss to pick me up Tuesday morning to enable me to return to work again.\n \nOnce at work I had to call BMW emergency services, Neva-Consultant\u2019s, BMW Specialist cars in Stevenage and Enterprise to try and sort collection of my vehicle and arrange a replacement vehicle. I then had to pay a \u00a350 deposit for the courtesy car.\n\nI spent over 2 hours at the very least on Tuesday morning on the phone to various companies trying to sort out problems with this vehicle and understand where I even stand in this whole situation. I then had to work late Tuesday to make up this time and arrange other people to collect my son from childcare.\n \nI received more of a detailed introduction to my replacement vehicle from Enterprise than I did the vehicle that I actually ordered.\n \nOn Wednesday 16th December 2015 I was notified by BMW Specialist cars in Stevenage that the problem was caused by an oil leak and that they had replaced the feeder pipe to the turbo and that the car was now fixed and ready for collection.\n\nI picked the vehicle up Wednesday evening after work, left my courtesy car at BMW and drove home. By the time I got home the smell and smoke returned so yet again I called BMW very frustrated. I was told over the phone that it was probably just excess oil still burning off yet nobody cared to warn me or mention this when I collected the vehicle.\n\nOn Thursday 17th December I drove the BMW to a clients in the morning where I stayed all day and drove home in the evening. I didn't seem to have any problems this day so assumed the 'excess oil' had burnt off as suggested.\n\nFriday morning I drove the vehicle to a friends' where it stayed until Saturday morning. Saturday 18th December I drove the car to collect my son and popped home to get ready to go Christmas shopping with him. When I got home at 12.30 yet again the smoke and smell had returned so I called BMW Snows in Portsmouth where the vehicle was purchased, BMW Special cars in Stevenage where the vehicles was repaired and eventually both fobbed me off to call BMW emergency services again.\n\nThe vehicle was collected at 3pm and the mechanic who collected it this time wasn't as rude as the first one and actually suggested that the excess oil story was a big lie and whilst he was looking at the problem he pointed out that the bonnet is also bent and doesn't shut properly. \n\nI finally got a courtesy car at around 5pm which I had to pay another \u00a350 deposit for and still hadn't received the refund for the first courtesy car! So \u00a3100 down at that present time.\n\nAll I have heard all week is people saying that it sounds like I have been given a 'Friday afternoon job' vehicle.\n \nThere is now over 300 miles on the clock of this BMW and I have probably driven only about 50 of them... if that!\n \nI have spent so many hours this week wasting my time on the phone to several companies regarding this vehicle and clearly getting no where. I have a full time job and a young son that I should be focusing on not spending my time sorting out problems with a brand new car.\n\nNot only has this vehicle managed to ruin my whole week last week, it also ruined my whole weekend and the problem is still not sorted a week later.\n\nI can't even begin to explain how stressed, disappointed and frustrated I am. Clearly nobody really cares because to them it's just a 9-5 job so as soon as it's home time it doesn't matter! I am so fed up of being fobbed off and ignored so I've decided to make this complaint public.",

          "Dear BMW, we are appalled at the way we have been treated over the timing chain issue. Our BMW has been on our drive with NO engine for over a year. Last November our timing chain snapped, suddenly whilst driving. Luckily there was no nasty accident. However, we had the car towed off the road by a local prestige garage, we subsequently called BMW and were told to take it to the local BMW in Bromley in Kent where it was very likely that we would be offered a repair as good will as it was a known fault. We had to pay \u00a31000 for an assessment BUT were then told that the repairs would cost \u00a310,000. The local prestige garage had said that the repair would cost around \u00a33500 for the same repair of the timing chain. We have since been a dispute with you, our finance company and the financial ombudsmen, because you will not admit to the fact this is a KNOWN fault despite over 600 cases of this being reported in the UK, it being investigated on watchdog AND reports of the fault ALL OVER THE INTERNET. The car was delivered back to us and has sat on our drive with NO engine in it for over a year now while we waste hours writing letters to you and the finance company seeking resolution. After a year of back and forth, in which we purchased a new car, and kept up our finance payments, we decided that we coudl no longer afford to pay for a car we no longer can drive. Today it is being picked up by the collection agency and we are left with NO car and have paid around \u00a315,000 in finance already plus now legal fees. AND GUESS WHAT - they have said this is the SECOND BMW this week they are picking up with a timing chain fault. So, Thanks so much for causing us stress, anguish, and stamping on your customers because you clearly think we are too little for you to bother about. As we have received no apology or admittance of the fact that this is a known fault, my only recourse will be to make sure others no longer fall foul to you ripping them off, I will be creating a website to discuss this particular issue ( I work in marketing and know exactly how to do this) and will be creating a series of viral videos to warn others against investing their hard earned money and savings and being crushed by a company they believed in.",

          "Ok!  I just want to say how UNRELIABLE OL BMW IS!!!!  My son has a 2005 Beamer!  Yep! It's a used one BUT a BMW none the less!  \nHere's the problem he has been having....My son called me one day when he went out to lunch, he was sitting, yes I said sitting in his car, in a parking lot!  At first he said he thought a gunshot went off!  Then he realized it was his airbag!  Yes I said his airbag!!!  And just sitting!  And his airbag went off in his car!  Left his ears ring!  This is NOT the first one that has done this! \nAnd so I said to him call BMW!  He said he has called BMW to have them fix this!  I said and so what did they do!  He said they had me bring it in, and they checked it out, and said that the sensor says that it has been in an accident!! And that BMW is NOT going to fix or repair anything!! \nWell.....here is the KICKER!!  MY son has NEVER had an accident in this car!  \nSO, this is my thoughts...BMW PUT a faulty car on the use car lot and re-sold it!!  \nNOW, just the other day, my son had a passenger in his car, and they were just driving down the road, and guess WHAT!  Yep!  Another airbag went off and hit her in the arm!  And she now has a bruise on her arm!  \nI have called BMW NUMEROUS TIMES!  Only to get a recording, and I have left message after message with my phone number attached, with no return phone call to try and get this matter resolved!  \nBecause NOW!  My son is driving around in a car THEY PRODUCED with all the airbag that have blown except for the one in the steering wheel, and my son has his seat as far back as he can to drive safely in fear of this bag blowing up in his face while he is driving, and maybe killing him! We all have heard of this on the news!  How dangerous these airbag in the steering wheel are throwing shards through your eyes and such!  \nNOT to now mention, God forbid if he should happen to get into a horrific accident, he now has NO airbags for some protection!!! Because, HELLO!!  They have all just about already deployed because of a faulty sensor and who knows what else because the car also shuts down and throws on the hazard lights, which could also caused my son to get rear ended!! Sounds like to me, the BMW technicians did a horrible job inspecting this car before putting it on the lot to be sold!  My faith in this company has fallen tremendously!!  Will never recommend anyone to purchase high end!  They DON'T always stand behind their product!!  New or used!  You should stand behind your product!!  And yes, I'm posting in other place as well!  The world needs to know!",

          "Our cars, the ultimate driving machines, such as the way they're designed, engineered, manufactured, and marketed, they provoke various forms of emotional responses.  Sometimes those emotions are positive, sometimes just downright negative (usually from other road users who don't share the same driving experience which happen to also include the other German auto brands.).  But that's OK.  I understand, because way back when I first laid my eyes on an E28 5 Series in the early 80's it is a very positive impression that cemented a young boy's motivation towards having one one day.  So much so that today not only, the passion for these cars are stronger than ever, but also the approach to living and working and generally doing things have also started to take on that of the Bavarian car maker's ethos.

When the 19-year-old student Maty\u00e1\u0161 Homola (https://instagram.com/matyashomola/) bought his first car, it was obviously a hard decision as to what model to choose. But despite the fact he has always been into motorsports, he didn't opt for a new car. He is now the proud owner of a 1978 BMW 3 Series, so his car is two times older than him. Lovingly, he named his 3 Series \u201eColette\u201c and takes great care in maintaining the classic soul of the car - he even has plans for exhibitions and some rally competitions.

Whenever the car wants, it starts only then\n5. Front & Rear Brake pads wear out before the due date\n6. The sensor system in the car suddenly stops working. So, now I have to open the car with a key.\n7. The reverse parking sensors sometimes works & sometimes shows PDC failure\n8.

From his position in the backseat, he watched the vehicles that passed and tried to recognise each model just by looking at their headlights. Later, after he and his father went to see the Ennstal-Classic Rally, Fabian became more and more fascinated by youngtimer and classic vehicles. And so the first car he bought did not roll directly off the production line, but it came rather with a great history. He chose the BMW 520i, built in 1987.

This car was bought as a family car, how can BMW justify sending a letter to recall faulty models, when clearly people's lives were at risk? \nIf we had known about this we would have had the car straight a garage to have the fault corrected.\nIf previous owners did not pay attention to the letter about the recall, Surely BMW are at blame to this seems it was such a serious issue. \nThis should have been made vital that the cars were returned. \n\nI would appreciate greatly if someone would contact me on the below details \n\nMobile number (UK) - 07514104555\n\nEmail: mickey-k-@hotmail.com\n\nSolicitors have been contacted.",

          "I want to share my horrific experience with a 2010 BMW 335d. Should a 5 year old car with less than 60K miles require an engine job costing $4,300? My 1994 BMW 525i lasted 18 years with very few problems. Unfortunately, I don't think BMW knows how to build diesel cars for the U.S., nor is it willing to stand behind its own badly designed products. The following is an email message I sent to BMW USA seeking assistance which comes back with a negative verbal response after 1 week:\n\nTo: BMW Customer Relations\nAttn: Resolution Specialist Aly\nFrom: Arvola Chan\nDate: April 9, 2015\nRe: 2010 BMW 335d (VIN WBAPN7C53AA266833)\n\nDear Ms. Aly:\n\nI last spoke to you on the phone on April 6, 2015 regarding the carbon buildup problem on my BMW 335d. At the time you told me that once it has been determined by an authorized BMW dealer that de-carbonization of the intake ports is necessary, BMW may be able to provide financial assistance to get this procedure done. Now I have in fact recommendations from two authorized BMW dealers, BMW of Mountain View and Stevens Creek BMW that carbon cleanup is the logical next step to resolve the recurring Service Engine Soon (SES) warning light problem. I tried calling you yesterday after receiving the recommendation from Stevens Creek BMW but was unable to reach you. Representative Alex told me that you will get back to me with the decision in 3 to 5 business days. In the meantime, I like to provide you with a documentation of the long history of SES problems in this car, why I think this car is unreliable, and why I think BMW should stand behind its own product.\n\nDate          Issue Mileage\n9/30/2010 SES         14500\n2/18/2011 SES         20688\n6/29/2011 SES         25961\n2/29/2012 SES         36735\n1/14/2013 SES         48718\n12/13/2013 SES         52352\n10/13/2014 SES         55112\n11/11/2014 SES         55627\n1/12/1015 SES         56315\n2/20/2015 SES         56988\n4/1/2015         SES         57705\n\nAs you can see, the SES warning is coming up increasingly frequently. Between October 2014 and February 2014, the car was serviced by Stevens Creek BMW for 4 times, each time under the California 7 year 70K miles emission warranty. During the 2/20/2015 service, a PUMA case (#60790270) was started. When the SES light came back on in March 2015, I called up BMW Customer Relations and talked to Representative Brittany. She told me if I was not satisfied with the workmanship at Stevens Creek BMW, I can bring the car to any other authorized BMW dealer. That is why I took the car to Mountain View BMW. Unfortunately, they refused to follow up on the PUMA case and just wanted me to pay for the de-carbonization.  I declined and took the car back to Stevens Creek BMW hoping they would follow up on the PUMA case. Again, they did not take that route but recommended de-carbonization.\n\nI hereby attach the two invoices from BMW of Mountain View and Stevens Creek BMW that contain their recommendations. If you need to see the earlier invoices, I will be happy to provide them.\n\nSincerely,\n\nArvola Chan",

          "Mini JCW Bad experience - Chassis TD47985\nI would like to share my bad experience BMW/Mini service center in Egypt.\nIt has always been a dream to own a mini cooper and when it happened, it turned to be a nightmare very quickly.Since I bought the car, I used to bring it to the service center 2-3 times a year for an average of 1-2 month each time due to the lack of response of the service advisers and the unavailability of spare parts!!! I was obligated to buy a second car due to the fact that my MINI is not reliable and is not available all the time. I don't want to drag you into details, however I would like to focus on the past 2 service experiences I had with Abo Rawash service center.\nTHE FIRST ONE: I entered my vehicle on 02/08/2014 with an oil and water mixture in the cooling system, I kept chasing the service advisers for more than 10 days to get the final diagnosis and what really needed to be replace as they were trying to up-sell the whole cooling system!!!! Finally I was able to receive the vehicle the on 24/09/2014 and I paid more than 3,000 EGP, but unfortunately they forgot to put new engine oil and oil filter!!!!!\nI traveled for 3 months after I received the car and when I came back, I discovered that the outside temperature sensor is not working and the radio CD is refusing to accept any CD, even the magazine of the CD CHANGER is not working and no one told me although that everything was working perfectly well before entering the service center, but I thought it is not a big deal and it might need to be cleaned or so.\nTHE SECOND ONE: After, 3000 KM the engine sound was very high and when I checked the oil level, it was almost empty. I checked the invoice of the last maintenance mentioned above and I discovered that there is no engine oil and oil filter mentioned in invoice. I got worried and I called the Eng. Hossam Hamoda telling him the case and that I needed a carrier to take my vehicle to the service center as its basically their mistake. He was very calm and told me that they don't own a carrier and that he won't be able to judge unless I bring the car to the service center by any means i want, because they don't support this!!! \nIs this the expected service from a premium brand?! I got a carrier and went to the service center on 21/02/2015, after a lot of chasing calls and SMSs, they told me that some parts needed to be changed that wasn't mentioned in the previous report as a trial for the usual up selling!!! The case is very simple, it needs an apology and changing engine oil & oil filter!!!\nTo cut the story short, I agreed to change all the things they wanted to change and they asked for a a down payment that I went and paid on 25th of Feb. Eng. Mohamed Fathi advised that it will arrive in 1-2 weeks maximum, and nothing arrived till now and he advised that we usually experience delays in the parts shipment and things will not arrive before 1st of April!!!!!\nI can't take this anymore! I want to return this vehicle to you and get my money back. I can't take the risk of selling it to anyone because it has a lot of problems, unreliable and the service center is not able to well maintain it and make the spare parts available.",

What makes us feel is that we have been had by BMW Malaysia despite we have discuss this issue numerous of times. Do you really care as you do not drive the car but us! Who paid for the car? Us! Let's take it from another angle where this is your BMW 528 and you have been had!!! At this moment, we have no car to move around and does BMW Malaysia care? Despite calling BMW Voice we have no call from BMW Malaysia even to lift up the telephone to call us.... Put in that picture and feel it with pressure or pleasure! As you might have check our info from our facebook, we too are in the service industry which commands good customer care but in this case, is there one in BMW?",

          "Our first BMW 323 air con broke down before warranty is over which we have to pay half the price for it... Thanks to BMW Malaysia! \nNow our second BMW 528 bought in Dec 2012 from BMW Lee Motor Kedah started to shiver after a 1.5 min drive on slowing down... This is when the avalanche of issues begins...with sometime in April 2014 hardly 1.5 years old having a mileage about less than 40000 km our BMW 528 has been hospitalized.  \nNice of BMW Ingress Auto Malaysia provided us a good hospitality and service since our first visit... From the very first issue of the BMW 528 engine shivers after a very short 1.5 minute drive, more parts of the car were replaced as the car front wheels begin to having cranky noise which steering rack, wish bones, bushes and etc were replaced....\nIn this such short period Our BMW 528 has been hospitalized and transplanted with new parts...and till now its still in the good hands of BMW Ingress Auto Razak and Hong including Kumar. With the final warranty checked together with further cranky noise coming off from the front wheels and now having the left rear shock absorber leaked... It is rather funny as our BMW 528 wishes to be hospitable with its good transplanted parts...in the warm arms of BMW Ingress. Is this the quality of BMW 528? Shocking to realized that BMW Malaysia replaces only one left shock absorber instead of both side. As per advice from at least two BMW authorized service centers replacement of shock absorber should be in pairs for the stability of the ride towards safety. Happened to be at BMW Melbourne service on 9th Feb 2015 they replaced a pair but here in Malaysia, why only one?\nAre we ignorant enough to accept only one? We wrote to BMW Voice on 31st Jan 2015 and was hospitable by BMW Voice Sufian's email 4th Feb 2015 that BMW Malaysia would be notified to response. As per our telephone conversation with Sufian on 10th Feb 2015 that BMW Malaysia would have contacted us regarding our email to BMW Malaysia. Contacted Ng of BMW Lee Motor who claimed that they have done their best to hear our distress. Till date BMW Malaysia never contacted us regarding the matter despite BMW Ingress Auto has advice them... Our BMW 528 is falling apart which is hardly 1.5 years of age. Having some meeting with BMW Ingress Razak yesterday 11th Feb 2015 and was informed that BMW Malaysia would like to close the case by asking us to accept the replacement of the right rear absorber.\nRecalling our early experience with our BMW 323 in our early years pertaining to the air con warranty, we were informed the BMW Malaysia did not respond as the staff were on leave and hence no response.. What's for now?\nDriving with Pleasure or Pressure with Quality of Parts seemed now our fate of having BMW 528 together with no response from BMW Malaysia. Is this how we are treated? What is the price of this BMW 528? This is the price of Fate....\nOur feelings shown above that BMW Malaysia left the heat to both BMW Ingress and BMW Lee Motor. Is this how the local principal treats their agents? What is BMW Voice is all about when there's no response from BMW Malaysia? Similar to our earlier experience the staff are on leave...and could not be bother...\nOur final comment is that \"This is how we were treated with the Most Hospitable Service from BMW\"...believing all the motto, claims, beliefs from BMW website...",

          "Could I get some advice please? Five weeks ago my father brought a BMW 520D from Coopers at Colchester, and paid over \u00a340k for it. After 5 weeks and 580 miles of use, the brake warning light came on. The vehicle was subsequently inspected by Coopers in Ipswich. We then received a call from them, and we were told that some non BMW approved parts had been fitted, and we must have had work carried out to the brakes by a third party. This is of course absolute nonsense. Why would we have had any work carried out by a third party? Why would it even need any work carried out after 580 miles? We were told that all the brakes would have to be changed, as they had the wrong type of grease all over them. Then came the issue of the warranty. We were told that BMW would not cover the cost of the 'repair' so it would be chargeable to my father. At this point, I'd stress that the car was five weeks old, had done 580 miles, and we'd never had any work carried out to it. So, to be told we'd be charged was upsetting and, quite frankly, insulting. Feeling pretty aggrieved, we're of the opinion that the car was driven off the forecourt of Coopers at Colchester with a brakes issue. What other explanation is there? Clearly, Coopers are of the opinion the brakes issue has been caused by us, but they're not applying any logic to that view-point. Why would we? It makes no sense. Yes, I'm sure that BMW have quality control, but it seems that Coopers are taking the stance that it is easier to apportion blame to the customer rather than even consider the fact that there could have been an issue before we received the car. Once again, please bear in mind the mileage of 580 miles!!! So, feeling aggrieved, we refused to pay for the replacement of the brakes, and countered that with the fact we feel we should be entitled to some form of compensation. After numerous discussions with the manufacturer and Coopers of Colchester, we haven't been able to agree. To settle the matter, we had asked for................the brakes to be repaired, a GardX car protection valet (RRP \u00a3500), and \u00a3500 cash settlement. I do not feel this is unreasonable bearing in mind the fact that my father had purchased a new car for over \u00a340k which evidently had  a fault with the brakes when it was driven off the forecourt. However, Coopers at Colchester would not meet our request. Yes, they did make an offer that was approximately half-way, but bearing in mind the reasonable request we'd made, it now becomes a matter of principle. So, my question is, what is BMW's view-point on this? Do you not feel a customer should be entitled to compensation when they've purchased a brand new car with faulty brakes? We're not talking about a minor cosmetic issue here - we're talking about a serious safety issue. I understand we have a warranty to cover us for the vehicle developing a fault. However, the vehicle did not develop a fault - it had it from day one. I'd be grateful for your thoughts on this please.",

          "Hello,\n\nbecause I don't know if anybody will read this or who will read this, I am writing this in general to BMW company.\nI would like to write you about my love to BMW cars. I remember since I was a kid, that I've always turned my head around when one of your cars went pass me. I'm simply in love in BMW cars. The \"kidneys\" on the front of the car were always catching my look. And when you later look at the whole car, you simply run out of words. Also as a kid, when we were at the stores, if I saw BMW model car I wanted it. But because we are in a small country, there were not a lot of BMW model cars here. Through the time of me growing up, I've allowed other kids that came to our house to play with my model cars and I've also gave them some of them because they wanted them. I was always the kid who was generous and willing to help. But through all this time, I never gave my first model car which I still have. It is of course a bit damaged because other kids were also playing with it, but it is still with me as my motivation of maybe owning one in the future. Now this model is a bit outdated now, it is a BMW 325i, I think from 1993. But I still have it and I am also sending you a picture of it with my BMW formula 1 car that I also kept. \nLater when I grown up a bit, I was around 12-16 years old, my parents took me many times to BMW dealership in our town, so that I could admire your cars. I remember once when we got there and the seller asked if he can help us in any way and my dad said, that not for now but that he brought a future customer with him. Of course he was thinking me. Then I was old enough to drive on my own so I was starting to go by myself to dealership to see the cars. And when I met my girlfriend (we are now almost 7 years together) and we talked about cars I said that my dream is to have a BMW. Last year I took her again to dealership here in Maribor and showed her the cars. She also loves them but at least for now, they are out of our reach to have it. At that time I remember we were looking at BMW X5, brand new with M package. I loved it because I like big, massive cars. But my girlfriend was almost like on a slide when she was leaving the passenger seat (I am 202cm tall, she is 158cm). I practically love all BMWs but because of my size I mostly look after 5 series and X5. Hopefully I will be able to buy one in future. I just love them and I know that someday I will own one brand new. \nSo this is my \"short\" story of my love and passion about BMW cars. And when I saw you've opened BMW Welt in Munich which is around 3 hours of drive from here, I have to see it. And I am planning to visit it this year.\n\nThank you for doing my dream cars and the most beautiful cars on planet!\nLuka from Slovenia",

Last year, 2013, there were at least forty-four deaths of children in vehicles; thirty-nine which has been confirmed as heatstroke and five which, based upon the known circumstances, are most likely heatstroke (2013 list). In 2012 there were 34 deaths of children due to hyperthermia (heatstroke) after being left in or having gained access to hot cars, trucks, vans and SUV's. Since 1998 there have been at least 619 documented cases of heatstroke deaths of children in vehicles. This data and study shows that these incidents can occur on days with relatively mild (i.e., ~ 70 degrees F) temperatures and that vehicles can reach life-threatening temperatures very rapidly.\n\nThere are also far too many \"close calls\" that fortunately do not result in a tragic death  \n\ntag, @ at mention, and # hashtag your car in the comments and share this on your car companies wall and with friends!

          "Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren, \n\nmittlerweile wurde, nach mehrmaliger R\u00fccksprache mit der BMW Niederlassung N\u00fcrnberg-Fischbach und Herrn Gschaider aus der BMW-Headquarter eine \u201eL\u00f6sung\u201c gefunden. Wir konnten den X5 zur\u00fcckgeben, jedoch gekoppelt mit der Bedingung ein mindestens gleicherma\u00dfen hochwertiges Fahrzeug wieder als 36-monatigen Leasingvertrag zu nehmen. Zu der Zeit h\u00e4tten wir einen 116d ben\u00f6tigt, jedoch wurde eben dieses Fahrzeug als Anschlussvertrag verweigert, da die monatliche Rate als zu gering gesehen wurde.\nNach langen \u00dcberlegungen und angesichts der Tatsache, dass die T\u00fcren beim X5 immer noch w\u00e4hrend der Fahrten aufsprangen, haben wir uns der Sicherheit wegen, gezwungenerma\u00dfen f\u00fcr einen 7er entschieden. \nDieser wurde nun als Fahrzeug im Anschlussvertrag akzeptiert. \nDas Fahrzeug wurde am 05.08.2016 in der BMW Niederlassung N\u00fcrnberg-Fischbach, Regensburger Str. 420, 90480 N\u00fcrnberg abgeholt. \n\nUnd schon am ersten Tag gab es wieder Schwierigkeiten mit dem Fahrzeug. \n\nAm 18.08.2016 war das Fahrzeug zum ersten mal in der Werkstatt: \n\nSitzl\u00fcftung hat Ger\u00e4usche gemacht, da der Ventilator unter den beiden vorderen Sitzen die Seitenw\u00e4nde ber\u00fchrt hatten. ( Hierf\u00fcr war das Fahrzeug mehr als 3 mal in der Werkstatt) \n2.   Fahrassistent f\u00e4llt immer wieder aus\n3.  Gestensteuerung bet\u00e4tigt sich automatisch, obwohl keine Geste gemacht wurde\n4.  Park Distance Control bremst das Fahrzeug beim R\u00fcckw\u00e4rtsfahren ruckartig ab, obwohl keine Gegenstand im Weg steht. \n5. Lenkradheizung war defekt und hat nicht ausreichende Hitze entwickelt\n6. Das Fahrzeug zeigt an, dass Motor\u00f6lstand zu hoch ist, obwohl kein \u00d6l nachgef\u00fcllt wurde\n7. Beleuchtungsanlage (Laserlicht) auf einmal defekt. \n\n8. !!!!!!!!!! Das Fahrzeug qualmt seit dem 31.12.2016 immer und immer wieder!!!!!!!! \nDer Rauch gelangt vom Motorraum in die Fahrerzelle und in den Kofferraum! \nW\u00e4hrend der Rauchentwicklung arbeitet die L\u00fcftung im Motorraum auf Hochtouren, obwohl der Motor bereits abgestellt wurde. \nDas Fahrzeug wurde beim 1. mal von der Pannenhilfe abgeschleppt.\nSeit dem hat das Fahrzeug mehr als 20 mal gequalmt. Dokumentiert wurde der Defekt 14 mal mit genauer Zeit- und Ortsangabe. Zus\u00e4tzlich haben wir auch Videomaterial, dass den Schaden belegen kann. \nDas Fahrzeug war mindestens 3 mal wegen eben dieser Rauchentwicklung in der Werkstatt der \nBMW Niederlassung N\u00fcrnberg-Fischbach, Regensburger Str. 420, 90480 N\u00fcrnberg. 3 mal konnte der Defekt nicht behoben werden. \nEs macht keinen Spa\u00df bei den Fahrten im Winter immer das Fenster offen haben zu m\u00fcssen. Der Rauch verursacht bei den Insassen Schwindelgef\u00fchle und \u00dcbelkeit. \nWir haben die Verkaufsleitung der BMW Niederlassung N\u00fcrnberg-Fischbach, Regensburger Str. 420, 90480 N\u00fcrnberg mit dieser Tatsache konfrontiert und wurde nur wieder die leere Versprechung gemacht, dass die Werkstatt sich dieses mal (nach mehrmaligen Versuchen) bem\u00fcht, den Fehler wirklich zu beseitigen. \n\nWir wollten nun nicht mehr mit dem Fahrzeug fahren und das Fahrzeug zur\u00fcckgeben bzw. vom Vertrag zur\u00fccktreten, da der Rauch im Fahrzeug kein zumutbarer Zustand ist. \nDer Wunsch vom Vertrag zur\u00fcckzutreten wurde wie erwartet bel\u00e4chelt und man belehrte uns, dass ein R\u00fccktritt nur mit einem gravierenden Fahrzeugfehler vereinbar w\u00e4re.\nJETZT stellen wir uns die Frage, ob den Rauch in der Fahrerzelle bei einer Vielzahl von Autofahrten denn kein gravierender Defekt ist? Den beissenden Geruch konnten sowohl die Meister aus der Werkstatt als auch unser Verk\u00e4ufer noch Tage danach riechen. \nWarum macht BMW so etwas mit seinen Kunden?!!!!\n\nAuswegslos haben wir uns nun Hilfe bei einem Anwalt geholt. Wir haben uns an die BMW Financial und an die BMW Niederlassung N\u00fcrnberg-Fischbach, Regensburger Str. 420, 90480 N\u00fcrnberg gewendet. \nDie BMW Financial meint nur, dass sie nicht der richtige Ansprechpartner f\u00fcr so einen Fall sind. \nDie BMW Niederlassung N\u00fcrnberg-Fischbach, Regensburger Str. 420, 90480 N\u00fcrnberg stellt sich einfach quer uns l\u00e4sst wiederum ihren Anwalt uns mitteilen, dass es keinen Grund gibt, vom Vertrag zur\u00fcckzutreten. \nWir sollen das Fahrzeug solange fahren, bis evtl. kein Rauch mehr auftritt. \nDas ist doch nicht euer ernst?!!! \n\nAnstatt sich best\u00fcrzt bei den Kunden zu entschuldigen und eine zufrieden stellende L\u00f6sung zu unterbreiten, verstecken die sich hinter einem Anwalt und lassen uns ausrichten, dass wir das Fahrzeug solange bewegen sollen, bis kein Rauch mehr entsteht. Die BMW Niederlassung N\u00fcrnberg-Fischbach, Regensburger Str. 420, 90480 N\u00fcrnberg riskiert bewusst die Gesundheit ihrer eigentlich treuen Kunden. \n\nBitte leiten Sie diesen Sachverhalt umgehend an Herrn Gschaider aus der Kundenzufriedenheits-Abteilung",

Aber was mich abfuckt, das nichts Neues gesucht und oder gebaut wird! Nat\u00fcrlich, wenn wir keine M\u00f6glichkeit haben auf !!abgeschlossenen!! RENNstrecken mit Sportler und Supermotos jeglicher CCM Zahl zu fahren nehmen wir die Stra\u00dfen oder Parkpl\u00e4tze. Aber Hey das ist laut Polizei auch wieder falsch. Das ist keine Anspielung gegen die Polizei, die k\u00f6nnen ja schlie\u00dflich auch nichts daf\u00fcr, sondern eher gegen die langweiligen B\u00fcrger und die hochbezahlten Nichtsnutze im Stadtrat .... nat\u00fcrlich sind an der Kartbahn B\u00fcrogeb\u00e4ude, klar st\u00f6ren \u00fcber 100dB. Aber wenigstens am Wochenende k\u00f6nnte man die Strecke nutzen! Was ich eig damit sagen m\u00f6chte, das mehr Jungendliche und zudem jegliche Art von Motorsportler sich einsetzten um sowas zu erhalten. Einfach schade wenn meine Kindheitheitsstrecke zerst\u00f6rt wird weil sich paar Leute beschweren.

Bei der Abholung erfuhr ich die Hiobsbotschaft: Motorschaden!!!\nNeben der Rechnung f\u00fcr die Inspektion bekam ich einen fetten Kostenvoranschlag f\u00fcr den Einbau eines Austauschmotors \ud83d\ude21. Das Auto ist 5 Jahre alt und hat ca 90T km.. Bei ca 70T km war das Zeichen f\u00fcr den Motor auf dem Display schon erschienen. Die Garantie ist klar abgelaufen. Alle Kulanzanfragen wurden von M\u00fcnchen abgelehnt, kein bisschen Entgegenkommen!! Ich fahre seit fast 15 Jahren nur BMW. So eine Sauerei. Mit meinem vorherigen BMW 316ti Compact hatte ich gleiche Problem. Der ist irgendwann einfach nicht mehr angesprungen. Den hatte ich auch mit null km gekauft und der hat auch keine 100 tausend km gehalten.. Inzwischen vertrete ich die Meinung: au\u00dfen hui und innen pfui (Billigschrott eingebaut, Splitter im \u00d6l, weil sich der Beh\u00e4lter aufl\u00f6st, Steuerungskette zu d\u00fcnn, ...)  \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e\nNie wieder BMW!!!",

          "Liebes BMW Team! \n\nWo andere sich des heutigen Fu\u00dfball-Spiels erfreuen, muss ich mich leider schwarz \u00e4rgern. \"Freude am Fahren\" so lautet euer langj\u00e4hriges Motto. Ich frage mich grade ob das ironisch gemeint ist. Wieso? Bei meinem 1er BMW Facelift, der noch zu den jungen Fahrzeugen z\u00e4hlt, wurde festgestellt dass meine \u00d6lwanne komplett durchgerostet ist. Ich frage mich wieso das passieren kann? Immerhin ist der Wagen regelm\u00e4\u00dfig in s\u00e4mtlichen Inspektionen und wird pfleglich behandelt. Mir ist zudem auch bewusst, dass man f\u00fcr die Premiummarke BMW durchaus mal mehr bezahlt, aber knapp 700 f\u00fcr den Austausch mit \u00d6lwechsel? Ist das euer ernst? Man muss die Vorderachse ausbauen und den Motor anheben, damit man sie \u00fcberhaupt tauschen kann? Meine Werkstadt sagte mir sie haben sowas bei einem jungen Fahrzeug noch nicht gesehen. Ich wollte eigentlich gerne in den Urlaub. Das wars dann mit der Freude am Fahren. Vielleicht habt ihr ja Interesse daran, meine Stimmung wieder zu heben. Ich schreib das hier in aller H\u00f6flichkeit, bin aber sehr ver\u00e4rgert! Vielleicht kann ich ja mal nen Wochenende nen i8 fahren?:) Viele Gr\u00fc\u00dfe und danke f\u00fcr eine m\u00f6gliche Antwort.",

Gut B6N is immer noch nicht in den Karten digitalisiert, schade aber nicht zu \u00e4ndern \n    b) Also Passau als Ziel eingegeben damit ich nicht durch Prag fahren muss. (Schnelle Route, nichts meiden)\n2) Alles zuerst gut. Keine Staus, die sonne scheint. \n3) Pl\u00f6tzlich werde ich von der Autobahn heruntergef\u00fchrt und immer auf kleinere Star\u00dfen geroutet. (siehe Bild)\n4) Angehalten Navi aus. 10 Min gewartet - Navi an - Route neu berechnet\n5) Aber der schrecken endet leider nicht. Am ende stehe ich auf einer Stra\u00dfe wo mein BMW gerade so draufpasst. \n6) Hotline angerufen - Gespr\u00e4ch verlief abgek\u00fcrzt so:\nHaben sie ihre navioptionen angeschaut - Ja\nHaben sie neugestartet -Ja\nIch gebe das an die Fachabteilung weiter - Das bringt mich aber hier nicht weiter\nWarte sie bitte es wird sich in den n\u00e4chsten Minuten jemand bei ihnen melden - gut \n7) Bis heute hat sich leider keiner Gemeldet.\n8) Also iPhoneRaus und mit iphone zur Autobahn navigiert.

DESPUES DE UN MES DE TENER EL AUTO EN LA AGENCIA me lo entregan el dia de ayer 10 de junio .. ya con \"la bomba nueva\" y que cree .. en menos de 12 hrs vuelve el mismo problema inicial.. realmente estoy muy molesto , indignado creo que en esta agencia me quieren ver la cara porque realmente al auto no le hicieron nada! el mismo problema me dio de vuelta.. y lo peor que ni un auto en prestamo dan mientras que reparan el tuyo.. como lo hacen en otras agencias ..  NO ENTIENDO TAMPOCO ESTAS FALLAS REPETITIVAS EN UN AUTO BMW ... espero me apoyen porque esto es inaceptable \nDATOS DE MI AUTO.\nA NOMBRE DE ; EDUARDO LEON LEON\nMODELO: 320 i 2014.\nNO SERIE.WBA3B110XEJ729987\nTELEFONO +52 9933122687\nMAIL. laloleon.luxurybroker@gmail.com",

No era la referencia. Ahora debo esperar mas tiempo. por otro lado un repuesto que pidieron por otro tema desde febrero, me dicen que debo esperar otro mes ( parece que se les olvido importarlo y hoy 2 meses despu\u00e9s que llamo a ver si lleg\u00f3 creo que se dan cuenta que no lo pidieron). En fin comprar un BMW y cualquier da\u00f1o debes esperar como es mi caso de tres a cuatro meses si no es mas con tu carro guardado Por que no tienen los respuestos o los piden equivocadamente.
