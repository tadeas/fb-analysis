Der Grund hierf\u00fcr waren defekte Injektoren, die trotz einer anstehenden Kundendienstma\u00dfnahme im Jahre 2013 nicht ausgewechselt worden waren. Obwohl dies f\u00fcr die meisten von mir befragten Werkst\u00e4tten der eindeutige Grund f\u00fcr den Motorschaden war, entzog sich die Daimler AG im Februar 2015 der Verantwortung und bestritt stets ihre Unschuld. Als Ergebnis wurde neulich \u00fcber dem Rechtsweg gerechterweise mir ein neuer Motor auf Kosten der Daimler AG erstritten. Trotz dessen entzieht sich die Daimler AG WIEDEREINMAL der Verantwortung  und zahlt f\u00fcr die 22 Monate, in der ich mein Fahrzeug nicht nutzen konnte, keine Entsch\u00e4digung aus. Anfangs hie\u00df es hat nichts mit den Injektoren zutun, jetzt hei\u00dft es von der Niederlassung sie h\u00e4tten uns w\u00e4hrend dem Besuch im Jahre 2013 auf die Kundendienstmasnahme hingewiesen. Somit entzieht sich die Daimler AG nicht nur der Verantwortung, sondern versucht dies mit nicht der Wahrheit entsprechenden Tatsachen zu verteidigen. Danke Mercedes-Benz.....",

          "Hallo Mercedes-Benz,\n\nvor ein paar Stunden haben wir uns hier im Netz getroffen. Ihr seid offen f\u00fcr Ideen, habt ihr auf einen Kommentar von mir geantwortet. Mercedes-Benz kommt auf mich zu \u2013 Wahnsinn! \nEuch direkt anzuschreiben, habe ich mich ehrlich gesagt gar nicht getraut. Egal. \n\nIhr habt eine unglaubliche Geschichte \u2013 nicht nur, dass ihr die Erfinder des Automobils seid (das wei\u00df wirklich jedes Kind), nein. Ihr habt auch die Markenwelt gepr\u00e4gt. \nWas ein paar Menschen vielleicht noch nicht wussten: Die 1891 gegr\u00fcndete Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft (DMG) verkaufte ihre Autos noch nicht unter dem Namen Mercedes. \nErst Emil Jellinek-Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s, ein \u00f6sterreichisch-ungarischer Diplomat hat den Namen ins Spiel gebracht. (Angelehnt an den Namen seiner Tochter). \n\nIch k\u00f6nnte jetzt noch einen weiteren, riesigen Bogen spannen \u00fcber eure gesamte Marken- und Fahrzeuggeschichte. Aber das mache ich nicht, sonst geht das Internet kaputt. \nNur soviel: Dieter Zetsche, euer derzeitiger Vorstandsvorsitzender, ist in Istanbul geboren. \nIhr merkt, worauf ich hinaus will. \nEs geht mir darum, Deutschland zu zeigen, dass es wichtig, richtig und gut ist, Menschen willkommen zu hei\u00dfen. Egal, wo sie herkommen. \nUnd dass es noch wichtiger ist, Menschen zu helfen \u2013 und ihnen eine Chance zu geben.\n\nIch finde, jeder sollte tun, was er kann. \n\nGl\u00fccklicherweise wird auch schon viel geholfen: Das f\u00e4ngt bei den viele Ehrenamtlichen an, die Spenden sammeln und verteilen, viele (kleine und gro\u00dfe) Unternehmen machen auch schon was. \n\nAber vor allem hier in den sozialen Medien wird geholfen. \nEs kommen immer mehr Aufrufe im Stil von: \u201eWer von euch hat mal einen Kombi und kann mir den kurz leihen? Ich habe hier n\u00e4mlich eine Menge Zeug, das ich an die Einrichtung XYZ spenden m\u00f6chte.\u201c\n\nDie Menschen (die hetzerischen Rechtsradikalen Idioten mal ausgenommen) nehmen die \u201esozialen Medien\u201c also tats\u00e4chlich beim Wort. \nEs ist so einfach. Und so sinnvoll.  \n\nDie vielen Spenden (Klamotten, Dachlatten, Waschmaschinen, Schulranzen, alles M\u00f6gliche), die auf diese Weise zusammenkommen, gehen zum Beispiel an Kinderg\u00e4rten, an Stadtteilprojekte wie Bauspielpl\u00e4tze und nat\u00fcrlich auch an Fl\u00fcchtlingsheime. \n\nJetzt meine \u00dcberlegung: \n\nGerade ihr als Erfinder des Automobils k\u00f6nntet den Menschen mehr geben: Fremdenfreundlichkeit zum Beispiel.\n\nDenn es w\u00e4re doch gro\u00dfartig, wenn all die Spenden in einem Mercedes Sprinter transportiert werden k\u00f6nnen, oder? (Ich m\u00f6chte hier nicht nach einem Auto f\u00fcr mich fragen, sondern f\u00fcr die vielen engagierten Menschen hier im Netz.) \n\nMit einem Sprinter w\u00e4re wirklich allen Beteiligten geholfen: Den Menschen, die etwas brauchen, den Menschen, die etwas geben wollen und auch euch als Firma Mercedes. \nDenn ihr w\u00fcrdet auch im Sympathieranking ein gigantisches Plus verzeichnen. (Euch kann ich es ja sagen: Opel, Fiat und Volkswagen wollten meine Idee nicht haben. Dacia ist noch in der Warteschleife.)\n\nWas ihr daf\u00fcr br\u00e4uchtet? Einen Sprinter aus eurer Produktion und ein etwas Verwaltungsaufwand f\u00fcr eure social Media-Abteilung. Und nat\u00fcrlich ein bisschen Mut. \n\nEin kleines Detail schenke ich euch noch: das Hashtag #spendensprinter \n\nIhr k\u00f6nnt das ja in Berlin mal ausprobieren. Oder in Hamburg. Oder, wenn ihr besonders mutig seid, in Freital oder Heidenau.\n\nAch so, weil mein erster (geliebter) Wagen ein Strichachter war, ihr bis hierher gelesen habt, und vor allem, weil ihr \u201edas Beste oder nichts\u201c gebt und wollt, kommen jetzt noch ein paar Ideen extra nur f\u00fcr Euch: \n\n1. Wie w\u00e4re es, wenn Ihr auf Eurem IAA-Stand auf jeden Wagen einen kleinen, aber trotzdem gut sichtbaren \u201eRefugees welcome\u201c-Sticker klebt? (Eine kleine Idee f\u00fcr ein gro\u00dfes Statement.)\n\n2. Es wird doch auf der IAA sicherlich einen VIP-Empfang geben, oder? Mit Fingerfood und Drinks. Wie w\u00e4re es, wenn Ihr genau diesen Empfang (kulinarisch genauso ausgestattet) einem Fl\u00fcchtlingsheim spenden w\u00fcrdet? Ganz ehrlich: Die VIPs bei Euch sind doch eh satt, oder?\n\n3. Wie w\u00e4re es, wenn Ihr vor der IAA einen riesigen LKW stellen w\u00fcrdet, wo Besucher Dinge spenden k\u00f6nnen? Auf der Plane steht nat\u00fcrlich auch \u201eRefugees Welcome\u201c. Nach der IAA bringt der LKW die Spenden dann an Fl\u00fcchtlingsheime.\n\n4. Wie w\u00e4re es, wenn Ihr ein paar Fl\u00fcchtingen einen Arbeitsplatz bei Euch geben \u2013 und Integration vorleben w\u00fcrdet?\n\n5. Wie w\u00e4re es, wenn ihr ein \u201eRefugees Welcome\u201c-Ausstattungspaket anbieten w\u00fcrdet? Leute, die sich ihr Auto (z.B. eine A-Klasse) mit dieser Ausstattung bestellen, spenden automatisch einen bestimmten Betrag an eine Bildungseinrichtung f\u00fcr Fl\u00fcchtlinge. \nDenn Bildung ist der Schl\u00fcssel zur Integration.\n\n6. Wie w\u00e4re es denn, wenn ihr Banner, Funkspots und Anzeigen schalten w\u00fcrdet, in denen Ihr ein Statement setzt. \u201eRefugees Welcome\u201c w\u00e4re auch hier die Botschaft. \nDamit die wenigen rechtsradikalen Idioten, die Mercedes fahren merken, dass auch ihr euch von ihnen distanziert. \nUnd damit auch die tr\u00e4gen Mitschwimmer merken, dass ihr als riesengro\u00dfe Marke ein klares Statement setzt. \nUnd damit die Fl\u00fcchtlinge, die hier ankommen, auf allen Kan\u00e4len willkommen gehei\u00dfen werden.\n\n\u00dcber eine Antwort w\u00fcrde ich mich freuen, und wenn ihr noch Fragen habt oder noch mehr Ideen haben wollt, meldet euch gern bei mir. \n\nDanke f\u00fcr\u00b4s Lesen. \n\nViele Gr\u00fc\u00dfe, \n\neuer SoBo.",

          "Sch\u00f6nen Guten Tag Mercedes-Benz Deutschland, ich m\u00f6chte mir hier auf diesem Wege nun einmal Luft verschaffen. Zu meinem Leidwesen ist mir vor 1 Woche jemand in meine C-Klasse gefahren und hat Fahrerflucht begangen. Da das anscheinend noch nicht Schlimm genug ist, schaffen ihre H\u00e4ndler es anscheinend nicht jemandem wie mir, warum auch immer, einen vern\u00fcnftigen Leihwagen w\u00e4hrend meines Werkstatt Aufenthaltes zur Verf\u00fcgung zu stellen. Mir ist bekannt das es eine Sache der Kulanz ist, aber dennoch dachte ich das Mercedes Deutschland in einem gewissen Ma\u00df so viel Service aufbringt, seinem Kunden der vor 2 Monaten erst einen Junge Sterne Wagen gekauft hat keinen Smart f\u00fcr einen t\u00e4glichen Arbeitsweg von 200km zur Verf\u00fcgung zu stellen. Wenn man hier \u00fcber eine Schadenssumme von 1000\u20ac reden w\u00fcrde, k\u00f6nnte man ja manche Argumente noch verstehen. Aber da der Schaden betr\u00e4chtlich h\u00f6her ist, ging ich davon aus das, dass Selbstverst\u00e4ndnis einer Deutschen Premium Marke ausreicht um seinem Kunden wenigstens einen Leihwagen der selben Klasse zur Verf\u00fcgung zu stellen. Wenn ich es nicht besser w\u00fcsste, w\u00fcrde ich sagen es liegt an meinem Alter ich kann mir n\u00e4mlich kaum vorstellen, dass sie einem 60 J\u00e4hrigen ebenfalls einen Smart geben w\u00fcrden. Soviel also zum Markenwandel hin zu modernen Autos f\u00fcr Junge Menschen. Bei diesem Service ist mein n\u00e4chstes Auto definitiv kein Mercedes mehr, sondern ein Audi oder BMW. #Mercedes #Mercedesbenz ##Benz ##Cklasse #BMW #Audi #VW.",

My car got in to accident due to malfunctioning of one of the Car Feature as per the Driver of Mercedes Benz India, who actually banged my car in to pavement in parking on 12th July and since then there is no reply in writing for the cause of the problem by Mercedes Benz India or their dealer on the same and in-fact they forced me to accept to pay for the claim myself through my insurance\n\nIn fact no stand by car provided as promised by the dealer before sales, even though they did the blunder to my car. We transported the car to the certified service center mentioned above and requested that they would examine the car and inform us of the damage done and provide us with a tentative cost before proceeding.After the examination the responsible personnel informed me that the all the damages were in the electrical system (boards) of the vehicle and that they started the engine and the engine was intact and suffered no damages. Till date Mercedes is not telling me the reason for accident and neither they are replying to any of my emails which shows the major fault in the car and they want to escape from the same. Not only did I have bad service from the service advisor Lizelle Oosthuizen when I dropped off my car, but I had to inconvenience people to organise a car because they didn't want to take me to my office as it was too far, (despite the fact I had asked them about pick up and drop off from my office when I booked the service and was told it was fine).",

          "I am writing from Lucknow, India. We purchased the Mercedes Benz E-class on 30th December 2008 through an authorized dealer but a recent incident and experience has left us appalled. On the night of 15th January, 2017 my father was driving the car, wearing the seat belt, when the car hit a bump on the street and the right wheel rod suffered an impact. This impact caused the airbags on the right side to get activated but to our shock the air bags were DEFLATED. There was no cushion or protection provided and considering Mercedes is known for its safety, this news left our entire family very upset. \nThankfully, my father did not suffer any injury as he managed to save his head from hitting the side, but what followed after was a series of email exchange with the Mercedes Benz dealership Smart Hoops in Lucknow \u2013 even more disappointing. \nMr. Amitava Mukherjee from the dealership promised to contact the headquarters in Pune, and quoted their reply to us in an email. Not only was Mercedes unapologetic, they seemed unaffected by such an incident and made light of a situation which has shaken up my entire family. Their email reply was vague and only repeated what happened. On questioning WHY THE AIRBAGS WERE DEFLATED we received no reply and they only said \u201cthere was no injury whatsoever\u201d. We were also assured that there will be representatives from the headquarters who will come to meet with us and give us an explanation- but that never happened, and we have only been able to be in contact with the local Smart Hoops dealership.\n\nTo top this off, we received a bill for Rs. 7,50,000 (approx. \u00a310,000) for \u201cfixing the airbags\u201d.\n\nI am amazed at the casual and irresponsible attitude by Mercedes Lucknow and Pune, when you are known as one of the finest car makers in the world. Additionally, my father happens to be a senior advocate in the High Court and Supreme Court of India, and we are taking this matter to court. It has been 11 days since the last email was sent to Mr. Amitava Mukherjee and we have not received a reply yet. After the recent numerous allegations on German car makers, and having faced this incident which was terribly handled by the company, we have completely lost faith in the German Automobiles. I would also like to let you know that the car has always been serviced on time. The last service was on the 30th of December, 2016 (15 days before incident) and the total run of the car has been a mere 38,000 kms. \n\nVery disappointed, we expected better. Never buying a Mercedes again. \n\n- Radhika Chandra.",

          "Hoping you can explain something to me, as I'm still rather baffled. Back in August 2016 (5 months ago), I reserved a build slot for a C43 AMG Coupe, for delivery in Feb 2017. However, I wasn't able to spec the car at that time, due to no commission number for the vehicle being made available. This was eventually received by my dealership in Dec 2016. After trying to process the specification, the dealer has confirmed that the ILS I requested isn't available. Per Mercedes-Benz, there is no allocation left. To keep things brief, let me just say this - your internal processes for customers to order and spec vehicles is not fit for purpose. Your customers have been complaining about this for a long time, as have your dealerships. In no way do I blame the dealership. This is purely the fault of Mercedes-Benz. My question to you is, why do you find it acceptable to provide a customer with a car that they're only partly-satisfied with, when spending approximately \u00a350,000 on the purchase? This is NOT what I would expect, nor is it acceptable to me. The fact that you're unable to fit my car with ILS due to \"insufficient allocation\" is completely unacceptable and an absolute disgrace on your part, when you recall that the build slot was reserved in Aug 2016. It's not a fault on my part that Mercedes-Benz only allowed me to spec the car in Dec 2016, once the commission number had been received, yet I'm the one who is being inconvenienced, and who is not receiving the specification I requested. I'd like you to explain (via private message) how we've come to be in this situation, and why there is absolutely nothing Mercedes-Benz can do to fit ILS. Note, the car is not due to be built until Feb 2017. Thank you.",

Such contact occurred the next morning where consultant Bruno claimed that he would take care of my case.\nI no longer had contact with the 0800, but when I called the dealership, they informed me that I had been denied again and that there would be no more to do.\nI entered with a complaint in the ReclameAqui (a brasilian website to solve consumer issues) and I posted on the Facebook page of Mercedes Brasil, in my social profile and it was shared by friends ...\nI had the very quick response on Facebook that my process was still under review, but after a few more days I was informed that the warranty was denied again.\nThe question is: \n1) Exactly when the car lost the warranty they noticed the defect and the factory refuses to solve it?\n2) If the factory claims that \"the defect does not match the mileage\", since this part is an impossible part to be damaged by the misuse, should not the factory have a moral obligation to solve the problem that the construction of that piece presented?\nI am outraged at how displeased the client is ... Mechanical defects can occur, but a turbine presenting problems with 45,000km of use is not an irrelevant fact and, in my opinion, a responsible automaker should not only afford the replacement but also analyze What happened so that more customers are not harmed.",

          "my boyfriend is having constant problems with mercedes Jason Lenos Alexandrou please all see below:\nFurther to my gearbox failing on a 2month old car I took it into the Mercedes branch at Waltham Cross as this was the nearest to my work. I felt that the urgency of the problem was completely over looked and unless I called Mercedes direct I was not updated by anyone. After numerous tests Mercedes came back to me saying they couldn\u2019t find a fault. I found this hard to believe as I had been driving the car when the gearbox went so I knew there was a problem somewhere.\n I wasn\u2019t happy with the feedback given and explained this to them. I didn\u2019t feel safe driving an almost brand new car after something had happened like that. When getting the car back a few more issuse came up one of which was the passages airbag wasn't working. The second the speedometer dials would not light up and took pictures of this so I wasn't makes to feel I was made it up. I then decided to get in contact with the Lakeside branch as that is where I purchased the car from.\n\nI called Mercedes Lakeside over 50 times, I left messages and sent emails to the salesman who sold me the car. I finally got hold of someone who agreed to take the car in and look into it further.\n Again after chasing Mercedes for updates I was told they had found a problem and the car needed a software update. This was a 2 month old car. There was no way that a car that new would need an update and I didn\u2019t feel that was a sufficient enough answer to the problem I had found.\n They said they would look into it further and provided me with an A Class courtesy car. I am paying a reasonable amount a month for the car I purchased and I felt the courtesy car should reflect that as I was continuing to pay for a car I was no longer driving. Mercedes were unhelpful and not understanding to this request.\n\nI called everyday sometimes more than once to try and speak to someone just to be kept in the loop. Everyone was extremely unhelpful. I therefore took it upon myself to call Head office to see if they could help me. I was told that they take 5 days to investigate.\n\nAfter 5 days I had heard nothing back this was a daily chase for me and I was getting absolutely know where. After 2 months of investigating I spoke to Mercedes head office and explained how disappointed I was with the service I had received. Not only have I not had my car for 2 months, no one was updating me with any progress or solutions. I expressed my feelings and explained that I felt I should be given some form of compensation. The lady I was on the phone to laughed at my request and made me feel unworthy. I didn\u2019t feel I was asking for anything out of the ordinary.\n\nI felt the only way forward for me was to now get solicitors involved. I was getting know where and felt I was being made a joke of.\n I would say that communication for Mercedes is one of their biggest downfalls. For such a large successful company you would expect the best from them. This has been on going now for over 4 months and I am still without the car that I am paying \u00a3450 a month for.

When a user comes in to purchase a car that costs a little under Rs. 1 Crore, I do believe a test drive is the most basic feature that one would require. It is a car after all. The lack of a vehicle to test drive was attributed to something about it being a car based on orders, despite which we went ahead and made the booking on 4th February, 2016 \nwhich was a total amount of Rs 82 lakhs\n\n2. We were assured of delivery by the month end , however 10 days after the booking date, I receive a call and am informed that the car delivery shall be delayed by atleast 45 days. With absolutely no reaction, I accepted the change and waited further for the car.\n\n3. Closer to the date of delivery, I receive another call, pushing the delivery date to end of May, thus making it more than a three month wait for the car. In the same call they also tell me some body shells are unavailable and therefore try to offer that I buy the GL 350\nI do believe that a consumer knows what he wants, and due to production issues, there should not be an attempt to pawn off whatever is available.\n\n4. There has also been an issue regarding the availability of the colour chosen by me, which is a standard cavansite blue, and therefore nothing out of this world that I am asking for.\n\n5. I have tried reaching out to the Mercedes Benz national customer service on multiple occasions, to only hear, \"we'll look into it and get back to you\", and to never hear back from them.\n\n6. I have been asked to pay more Rs 3.65 lakhs more for some small addition such as Apple CarPlay and backseat window curtains which i have been told are new additional features to the car manufactured in 2016. If these weren't a feature when I made the purchase, I don't see why I should pay an added premium due to the poor delivery time by the company\n\nI sincerely believe this quality of service is going to drive away otherwise loyalists to the hands of other luxury automobile companies who definitely offer me service worth the money I'm paying.\nI have been a BMW consumer for over 7 years now, and cannot even begin to compare the disparity between the quality of service.\n\nI can assure you that my first purchase from Mercedes will be my last unless I receive some sort of acknowledgement and action from your team.\n\nThank you.",

They didn't even have stock in the country the first time. Took the 7 weeks to get tyres in. I have asked if I can use better quality tyres but was told the warranty would be nullified if I did so.

          "I am Dr. Bagewadikar, writing here regarding our recent purchase Mercedes Benz ML 250 CDI Reg. No. MH-13-BN- 8289 at  B.U. BHANDARI MERCEDES BENZ PRIVATE LTD, PUNE, maharashtra, India.This \"biggest brand in the world\" is making our experience worsen each time it is driven. Hence, I have put forth all my worries, problems and concerns with this 'branded' vehicle, Mercedes Benz; through this post. \nWe purchased ML 250 CDI on the 6th of January 2016 and since then, our nightmares started with this machine. \nFor starters I want to launch a complaint against B.U. BHANDARI, MERCEDES BENZ PRIVATE LTD, PUNE for their incapability. I do not understand why this shameless dealer was appointed by Mercedes Benz, India for such a giant brand in the automobile industry. We were shocked to see their service and hospitality towards their customers. \n     We booked this car and the delivery date was committed to me which never happened. We called them a lot of times to ask about the delivery status but got a zero response.\nAnother brick in the wall was when We took the delivery, a duplicate key wasn't given  from your appointed dealer, B.U BHANDARI, MERCEDES BENZ PRIVATE LTD, PUNE. We followed this up for 15 days straight,  requesting them and  calling them at times they had asked me to for the status of the key set. We got the duplicate key after 20 days. This was one of the experience that I wouldn't have ever imagined would happen. But We stood calm through and after the 15 days of torture.\nNow tell me, had I come to buy groceries or fruits at this dealer? Or a bicycle at this showroom? No. Well, this also never happened when I actually bought a bicycle when I was a kid, I was provided with a set of 3 keys on the bicycle delivery date!\nDocumentation plays an important part for assests like cars, doesn't it? We were not handed all the documents at the time of delivery by your dealer. Again, We had to follow up with them and waste my time for another 10 days requesting them a 1000 times.\nRidiculous might be an understatement, but the car reading is just 3,500 kms and already has had 2 tyres bursting at the speed of 5 km/hr. We are paying 65 lacks for this car, and there are tyre bursts happening at 3,500 kms of running, it means that Mercedes Benz provides its customers with substandard, poor quality tyres, don't they?\nSo, Mercedes Benz has 4 x 4 feature and at the speed of 5 km/hr the tyre bursts. How can one now even think about driving it on a rough road? The tyres have a really bad cut and you can take a look at the pictures that I will be attaching with this post.\nWe have 3 Toyota Fortuner, one has a running of 1,17,500 kms, the other one at 95,000 kms and the third one at 60,000 kms but it never put us through such pathetic experiences while we drove at any speed, on any terrain and in the roughest conditions. tyre details- continental 255/55 R18. Two tires are already damaged and other two are on the verge of burst. How can Mercedes India provide such useless and pathetic tires with the so called premium car??\nIf Mercedes Benz fails to provide best quality materials for their cars, then it's time they should close down. They don't need to sell cars anymore or charge a hand and leg for this poor quality. I request you to even change your slogan from 'Best, or nothing!' to 'actually nothing'!",

If there is any possibilities to press charges against Mercedes and Emil Fray in front of the court of law, I will not hesitate to do so. You will be informed on time. \n\nTo clarify my standpoint:\nOn 9th February car has shown the message on the display \u201cBrake wear Visit workshop\" (photo exists)\nOn 10th February Mr Rakic visited Emil Fray service about 8:00 am to check if the car was safe for trip 360km.\nService told him that they just RESET the car and that the BATTERY that was supplying SBC was the problem, so the trip was safe!!!\nMr. Rakic started the trip and on the speed of 120km/h he noticed that he hadn\u2019t a brake!!!\nGuys from Daimler:\nWhat is your opinion? \n1. Did the driver have  time to think about the intensity of pressure on the pedal if he, let\u2019s say, had to break in front of \"pay toll\" or children crossing the road? \n2. Do you think that even speed limit of 50km/h would save him, or someone else,  from been killed without brakes?\nNow, this is not the question of reparation with payment, but safety. Mr. Rakic was very upset and nearly on the edge of nervous instability when he noticed  malfunction of breaks which was not mechanical, so, maybe  you could say his fault, but somewhat else!\n\nOur company\u2019s car was regularly maintained in Mercedes service since 2004, twice a year, times 300EUR (arround one new car). All that for safety and reliability of the Company\u2019s drivers and other traffic participants. So, your partners are trying to convince me that someone has to monitor from time to time if the brake is ok while driving?! I have bought second Mercedes car E220 class, brand new and now with services like this,  I am sure that it will not be entering  your service.  \n\nConclusion: \nAs I mentioned above, my lawyers will review all facts and you will be informed about further actions in next few days\nTill I make a final decision, I will put all my aspects and facts on ALL social network sites every day beginning with FB. \nIf I find necessary, this case will be published on TV, Press releases etc. This post will follow the answer received by service!\n\nWith respect\nNikola Rakic.",

          "Hello, I\u2019m writing this to make people aware of the customer service I got from Mercedes Benz and it might want you to reconsider your options when buying a new car.\n\nI was a Steelworker at SSI UK in Redcar and I was made redundant on the 2nd October 2015, with no notice and no redundancy packages. I got the government statuary packages which is capped and get about 20/30% of what I should have got. I bought my Mercedes in August 2015 and there were no signs that the steelworks were going to close, as we where told lies about what was happening behind close doors. So since the steelworks closed, I\u2019ve looked at every possible avenue, I looked at selling the car, but I owe \u00a33k plus then what the cars worth to my settlement agreement. Money I don\u2019t have to make up for it. I looked at buying a much cheaper car but I\u2019m in that much negative equity, that the \u00a33k plus gets put on my new finance so my \u00a3120 a month car goes to \u00a3200 plus a month car. Plus, I\u2019m unemployed and can\u2019t get a contract with anyone. So I rang Mercedes Benz finance. And I asked them if I can reduce my monthly bill to \u00a3200 per month until May. At the moment I\u2019m doing my HGV licence, I\u2019m doing my Class 2 and Class 1 licence. I\u2019ve just completed my CPC tests, my theory and Hazards and last week I was on a ADR course. So I\u2019m doing everything I can to get back into work. But I don\u2019t have my Class 2 practical test in April. So I went to Mercedes Benz to ask them if they will Restructure my payments until may. That\u2019s FOUR payments I was asking at \u00a3200 per month. Until I take my test. They declined it and told me to Voluntary surrender my vehicle. Which will ruin my credit rating for YEARS! I just don\u2019t understand why they will let me suffer for YEARS just for a few months at a less pay rate? Are they just being pure greedy? Doesn\u2019t give me the impression that they care about the person driving the car. I\u2019ve even told them to add 3-4 months on my contact at the end so they wont lose out. But no they want the car back. I haven\u2019t even missed a single payment, but now I\u2019m running of money and can\u2019t afford to pay the full monthly amount until I get back in to work in may. So i'm asking for mercedes benz to accept my offer on \u00a3200 per month until may.\nThank you for Reading.",

My father didn\u2019t restart the engine and passed away due to a heart attack on spot. \n\nWe transported the car to the certified service center mentioned above and requested that they would examine the car and inform us of the damage done and provide us with a tentative cost before proceeding.After the examination the responsible personnel informed me that the all the damages were in the electrical system (boards) of the vehicle and that they started the engine and the engine was intact and suffered no damages.\n\nI decided not to proceed with the repairs due to the high cost and withdrew the car from the service center.When the car was examined by our mechanic, we were shocked to discover that there are cracks in the engine block. This happened due to the fact that the technicians of the ANA center did not verify that the engine was free from water before attempting to start the engine.This additional damage caused by your service center will cause me to incur additional cost and will affect your company's reputation. \n\nIn addition to that I would like to highlight that my family is spending a hard time without a car which will definitely take a long time in order to be fixed and brought to it's normal condition.\n\nI look forward to settling this matter amicably.

          "Mercedes India and T&T Motors are taking customers for a ride in India.\n\n I have a 1.5 yr old E Class and its been more in the workshop then used for my leisure. totally unreliable. I have a 4 month old child I cannot take in the car since I am scared it may break down anytime. When i bought the car i felt there was too much vibration and immediately complained to the dealership. in the meantime my battery died and they had to take the car for battery replacement. they checked the vibration issue and asked to fix a pulley and belt but because both were not in stock therefore they fixed the car as it is. the issue was not resolved completely and a follow up was done with me. I told them the same issue was still there and they would do the needful. \nMy car goes for servicing. i tell them the list of complaints including the vibration and that the parking sensors are faulty as they react late due to which my car had been hit while reversing. thank god no one was hurt.\nI am told that the engine mounting, gearbox mounting and break pad need to be replaced. I agreed to all. when the car came back only the brake pads had been changed but now the car was out of alignment and 1 of the rims bent which my alignment company informed when I was getting it done. 3 tires had gone bald due to the alignment and rim issue which was not there when I sent my car for repair.\n\nAfter a year and few months had gone by since I bought the car I started complaining and requesting T&T motors for 3 months and to Mercedes India for 1 month for them to finally take my car for repair of gearbox and engine mounting replacement. this was the real reason for the vibration.\n\nit was shocking for a 20K driven car to go thru such extreme repairs. anyways the car comes back after repairs of 1 month and I was sent a mail that Mercedes team has come from India operations head office from pune and checked the car is perfect. the car arrives home and has the same vibration issue plus just after 1 day the engine fault is on and some squeaky noise is coming from the engine.\n\nSo to sum it up I have worked very hard to buy a over priced MB in india which I cannot take around because of the unreliability. I have paid for full service package of 3 years out of which 1 year has been used only to wait for parts.\n\nthank you Mercedes Benz. I chose your brand for reliability and comfort but I guess both are not an element for Mercedes anymore.\n\nThank you again\nAjitabh Puri\nDirector\nAVP Solutions\nCar no. - DL6CM6013\nTel - +91-9873350318.",

          "I have never come across a worse brand in my entire life! I will never buy another Mercedes Benz again nor will I ever recommend it to anyone I come across, in fact I will go out of my way to convince them to buy another brand whether they be friend, relative, enemy, or random stranger on the street. I've told this same story below over and over to everyone I know, but now it\u2019s time for others to hear about the experience they can truly expect from Mercedes Benz. I'm not one to complain but I've reached my limit now.\n\nLike other car buyers I was taken aback when I first saw the new A-Class. I thought to myself this is the one! Alas that was not to be. I placed my order in July 2013, placed my deposit and so began the wait. After 3 months of absolutely no contact from Mercedes Benz Umhlanga I contacted my sales rep to check the status of my order, only to then be told the sales representative had left and my new one had not bothered to contact me. Surprised to find I had not been contacted I queried about the status of my order. Only to now find out my car had been \"lost\" and my order apparently had not been made, eventually you found an order for me to take over from another customer who was going to cancel... so back on track or so I thought. This wasn't the least of my worries at this point in time. \n\nAs if the lost order and lack of contact was not enough. Mercedes then decide it\u2019s a good time to increase the price of all A-Class models, after 4 months of me waiting for the vehicle and me having placed a deposit on the car for an agreed price it\u2019s increased by an astonishing R80 000 with no notification/communication to me. This was not an amount that I had budgeted for. No one I spoke with would do anything about it and the previous price would not be adhered to as it was for others because my car was delayed and would only arrive the following year (apparently that\u2019s my fault, not due to Mercedes production capacity problems), whereas Mercedes\u2019 other customers had their prices honoured. Nothing I did could get you to stick to the original price, but I reluctantly and eventually accepted the increase and didn't cancel my order, after all I was going to own a Mercedes Benz a luxury German car that's better than any other brand on the market. (How I regret this decision to this day)\n\n\"But you can't have a sun roof any more, the factory is on strike/closing down in Europe and there are no other manufacturers for it, so your car is going to take a few months longer if you still want it\", \"We can\u2019t give you a time line\". Fair enough, then remove the sunroof so I can get my car without delay. But then after removing the sunroof you come with more delays, \"production to sub-Sahara Africa has been cut\". Fine I'll wait, I want my luxury German vehicle. It must be worth the wait IT'S A MERC after all, \u201cthe best or nothing\u201d.\n\nEventually after 8-9months of waiting my car arrives. Without the sunroof and now 25% more expensive than the original price I had agreed to when it was originally ordered and had placed a deposit for. Happy ending? I think not. One week after having my car a rattle starts to come from the left passenger door panel. \nI take it in to be assessed only to be told \"Sorry we can't reproduce the sound\". As the months went by it's gotten progressively worse, I hear it every day without fail, sure I will agree it\u2019s not easily reproducible, you won\u2019t hear it all the time but its overly frequent, and it\u2019s not a soft noise that one can dismiss easily even with the radio on. I've owned my vehicle since May 2014, I've taken it in a total of 4 times now and each time you give it back to me with the rattle worse than before... I've tried both your Mercedes Benz Umhlanga branch and your Pinetown Mercedes Benz NMI-DSM branch. It hasn't even been in for its first general service yet. It's not only me though, a friend purchased the A45 and he has the same rattle from the same place and his car is R200 000 more expensive than mine. So apparently you have a manufacturing fault.\n\nFinally to make matters worse, a stone hit my windshield last year August and cracked the windscreen. I've been waiting 6 months for a replacement, no one has stock of a brand new models windscreen... the car has been in production for almost 2 years now and not even Germany has stock? This is what I\u2019ve been told time and time again. Today was Mercedes Benz saving grace, I was told a windshield would be available. So I took in my car this morning to Glasfit as my insurance company instructs me to, to have it fitted. Low and behold Mercedes Benz has ordered the wrong windscreen using my chassis number. So now what? I wait another 6 months? So 1 year for a replacement windscreen? The incompetence I\u2019m surrounded by is astonishing. I wasted, R400 000, nearly 1/2 a million rand on a car that has no spares and a terrible build quality. As soon as my car is fixed I'm selling it and getting myself an Audi or BMW. Mercedes can't get out of my life fast enough at this point.\n\nI don't expect to hear from you or for a replay of any sort. I've gotten use to this level of service now. I always have to chase after you, you've lost me as a fan and a customer for life. My parents drive Mercedes as well and you've put them off as well, they won\u2019t be trading in for a new model I can guarantee you that.",

          "I recently purchased a 2014 Mercedes GL 450.  There were many issues with that, I won't get into those problems now, however I did want to share that one of the reasons I purchased a Mercedes was quality of service I knew I would be provided.  Buying a luxury vehicle there is a certain assumption that the class of service is much higher than your average vehicle.  \nIn my short ownership, I find this to not be true of Mercedes.  I recently had to bring my vehicle in for a part to be replaced (which is another issue because why a brand new vehicle needs an emissions part is confusing) - upon pick up (the first time) I noticed the illuminating lights of the running boards were no longer working.  After leaving my vehicle again with Erin the service adviser, Nathan Haugh the service manager assured me they would fix it up properly.  I have since tried to pick this vehicle up twice, still not working and only to be told that the running lights don't come on when you use  the remote - to have to go online and prove this by sending a video, you can imagine I am pretty upset.  \nFinally picked up the vehicle yesterday and it now works properly.  I truly love the car, else I would have traded it in at this point.  I simply cannot understand how Mercedes doesn't know how their vehicles work, nor do they care about how they treat customers.  Nathan and all pretty much were happy to get me out of their hair.  Mercedes - a real disappointment.  Next time I will stick with a BMW. \n\n-Colleen Wells.",

          "What Happens when you deal with a big brand like the GREAT Mercedes Benz??\nThe short answer: Disappointment. Big names have only big fonts.\n\nThe detailed answer:\nIn very few words, those people, whether in Egypt or Germany, don't respect nor understand the brand they have. \nI drove my car for 8000 km and had an engine breakdown. The cost of the new engine is between 100-150 thousand EGP. The car was in the warranty, BUT Mercedes Egypt refused to fix the engine within the warranty and they claimed I used the wrong fuel. They diagnosed a sample of the fuel and reported it was 91.7 octanes. Given that the fuel that was in the car was 95 octanes, from MOBIL gas station. \nI filed a complaint at Customer Protection Agency CPA, and after a lot of negotiations and warnings, Mercedes insisted on refusing to fix the vehicle. \n- The CPA filed a case at the Prosecutor General's office against Mercedes and will take Mercedes to court. \n- I had many correspondences with the Mercedes headquarters in Germany and had clearly stated that this is completely my legal right and it's is confirmed by the law in Egypt, and that Mercedes Egypt is breaching the law. SURPRISINGLY, the answer was \"we cannot help\". \n\nSo the questions here to Mercedes-Benz is:\n1- What does if take for a supposedly big company like Mercedes to give a customer their legal right?? Doesn't it even matter to reserve your image, and the trust people will lose in your brand?\n2- Is Mercedes ONLY concern now is making huge sales numbers by dishonestly covering for such serious car defects?? The number of engine breakdowns is getting ridiculously huge in 2013-2014 while we do not hear of those problems with BMW! Why is that?!!!",

          "SILENCE IS THE BEST POLICY \n\nHaving failed miserably with the Mercedes, Country, Regional and Global Customer Services,  I am now resorting to social media, hoping to grab the attention of the Co\u2019s senior management, representing one of the - so called - most admired organizations in the world. A little more than 2 years ago, I purchased a brand new Mercedes from the authorized dealership (Shahnawaz Ltd.) in Lahore, Pakistan. A dream come true for me for which I had saved for years. I paid a little more than 60,000 USD for a C180 \u2013 indeed this is how much it costs in my country due to heavy import duties and taxes. Within a matter of a few months, one of the tyres developed a large swelling on it. The authorized workshop staff did not want to register the complaint and simply changed it with the spare wheel. Subsequently by the end of two years, in April 2014, when the car had run a little more than 14000 km, all the  other four tyres developed the same problem not only rendering them useless but also dangerous because one of the tyres bursted on the road. I have not been able to use the car for the last 4 months. When reported, the only response I have received to-date is from the local service centre saying that this is due to local road conditions and thus not something Continental (tyre manufacturer) can accept responsibility for. I have repeatedly told them that I have nothing to do with Continental and that I hold Mercedes responsible for this since they were the ones who chose to supply these tyres. Mercedes people all over are not bothered and what to talk of giving me an explanation they prefer to remain silent and totally ignore. Shocking !\n\nI have been driving Toyota's and Honda's for more than 40 years on the same roads and this has never happened. Audi and BMW users tell me this has never happened with their cars in Pakistan. Mercedes has been officially conducting business in this country for more than 20 years and they still blame the roads in the country for the problem and not themselves? My sources tell me that lately, this is a complaint that many other Mercedes customers have also had but all in vein. I am also told that  Mercedes have lately switched to Bridgestone Turanza tyres instead of the old Continental faulty tyres, yet in my case they are not ready to accept their fault. If a technical team visits my city, they will realize the roads in this city are generally very good. If they still stick to their explanation, can they tell me why the same problem is not occurring with other brands of tyres and cars.   Needless to say, the distress that I have gone through trying to repeatedly make contact with Mercedes at all levels, and for a car which required the proverbial \u2018blood sweat and tears\u2019 to save for, has been very very painful for me.\n\nWhere is the ownership? Mercedes can be proud of one of the highest quality standards but once in a while when they get it wrong, they need to boldly accept responsibility and live the claimed values. They can very proudly boast of developing the sophisticated first of its kind Rescue Assist system with QR codes and Multi beam LED safety lights but not at the cost of ignoring the very basic components of car assembly.\n\nI have copies of innumerable emails to which I have to date, after a lapse of months, not received a single response, other than the initial explanation given by the local office. The Germany office has only forwarded the complaint to their Regional office in Dubai who have in turn forwarded it back to the local office in Pakistan. Please be reminded that the local office has already completed its investigation and given me their explanation, which I have repeatedly refused to accept. What to talk of the local Dealership, the Dubai office has also very proudly upheld the Head office policy of 'Keep Silent and Ignore'. Copies of emails sent to the global CEO and Heads of R&D, Sales, Customer Care and Legal Departments in Germany and those sent to the Regional office in Dubai are on record and can also be provided on request. None of them bothered to respond.  Pictures of defective tyres are attached. \n\nI am lost for words given the lack of response and customer service by such an elite organization. Are the claimed values just a facade? or is Mercedes simply turning a blind eye and a deaf ear because their business, operating in Pakistan, for them is only a drop in the ocean? Is 'IGNORE'  the company policy for all customers or only for those 'privileged' ones in  a third world country? Would the service standard and level of response be different if I had purchased the car in the UK or USA?\n\nNext steps:I have taken legal advice and have also made informal contact with the local Consumer Association and the Consumer Protection Court. I look forward to an adequate response within one week, failing which I will be left with no other option but to go viral with this experience, get in touch with all the other customers facing the same complaint and collectively register a law suit in the court to claim damages.",

I have also owned a used C class in my college days, and still own a 2013 CLS550. \n\nOn the ML, my wife and I barely put on more than 12,000 miles per year, it is lightly used, and super well maintained.  BUT the randomest things have gone wrong with the vehicle. \n\nHere is a list:\n- The first service came on at about 4000 miles.  I was told that this would not happen until 10,000 miles.  I should have known better then.\n\n- At about 10,000 miles we got a system error and the car just wouldn't turn on\n\n- At about 20,000 miles I had brought the SUV in because water was getting into the mirror reflectors, and I was told by the dealership that somebody had super glued the mirror and almost neglected to fix my mirror.  I mean, I bought the car brand new.  Why would I superglue my folding mirror???  I have the P3 package (fully loaded).  Again, why would I ever mess with a car like this, having been fully covered.  The dealership eventually took car of it. \n\n- Then randomly starting 30k miles, my windows would get all screwed up.  You push down, the window would go up.  For the longest time it was my driver's side window.  Now it's my passenger's side.  I brought it in once to complain, and they \"reset it\". \n\n- Starting 40k miles, the plastic on the exterior lining on the car started to peel.  Still is peeling.  So embarrassing on a Benz.\n\n- At about the 50k mile mark, the entire lining of the sunroof came off.  I live in New England and barely use it.  How does the lining come off??   This was the last \"under warranty\" service I had. \n\n- At about the 55k mile mark, the lock on the back door completely gave out.  The SUV is barely 4.5 years old.  How does this lock break???\n\n- At about the 62k mile mark, my horn went.   The mechanic suggested that the snow and salt corroded the horn as it designed to face forward.  The frigget horn?   Separately, I have a 2005 Toyota Camry, without about 180,000 miles on it (and going), and nothing close to the crap above has ever happened to it!!!   While I had the mechanic fix the horn, they also replaced the left rear brake light.  \n\n- Now the passenger back door wont lock or unlock with power locks.  You have to manually close it.   And guess what, the left rear brake light is out again. \n\nWhat gives????!?!?!?   I'm done with this SUV.   I'm a huge fan of Mercedes.   My CLS kicks butt (though I felt the same way about the ML).  But the track record of my ML, and the little support I got from calling customer support, I'm done buying anymore.  To think, I was about a month away from upgrading to the GL450 (call the dealership, they know).  And hec, I even inquired 3 weeks ago for a Mercedes Sprinter for my business.  NO THANK YOU!\n\nI'm going to enjoy the CLS for as long as it cooperates.  But the ML is being traded for a Pilot or Highlander before the end of week. \n\nThanks but no thanks!",

          "Very good glocalisation strategy of quality and service in my place!  I bought a brand new car. After ride one hours just 7km distance from the shop. The inside car air-condition became feels 45 degree temperature and white smoke happen in front of the car. Then the car dead at the road side. Wonderful promotion but nothing inform from customer support when I happened it like they mention on the web site support service! Arrogance customer service that I called a hundred of phone just told me wait for dealer reply me. I almost got it called to the wrong number. Is it possible Mercedes-Benz let the local market to co-ordinate the quality and service or out of control already? Where the traditional spirit of Mercedes-Benz? I bought the import car, not joint venture car of Mercedes-Benz. Did Benz already share ours local market spirit to produce all the world that import car follow this quality as well?I m\n feel so  BAD!!!!!Mercedes-Benz!!!!",

          "This is how Mercedes Benz SA (Bedfordview dealership) returned my car. Not only did I have bad service from the service advisor Lizelle Oosthuizen when I dropped off my car, but I had to inconvenience people to organise a car because they didn't want to take me to my office as it was too far, (despite the fact I had asked them about pick up and drop off from my office when I booked the service and was told it was fine).  \r\n\r\nI spoke with the branch manager Megan who said she would speak to the advisor regarding the matter. The car was returned with issues and they stained the interiors with greasy fingerprints. \r\n\r\nWhen I drove out from the dealership the car had an unusual rattle, I immediately returned to the dealership last night and Wesley confirmed there was an issue, he said he would report it to Megan and they would contact me in the morning to sort it out. I am still waiting. \r\n\r\nSubsequently I lodged a complaint this morning with your head office, needless to say still no feedback from anyone. Obviously you are not taking this matter very seriously. This is appalling service Mercedes. I want it SORTED immediately.",

          "Here's my review on the 2012 Mercedes Benz C350 Coupe: 3.5 V6, 225Kw's 370Nm's:\n \nThe 2012 Mercedes Benz C350 Coupe is, with the exception of the C63 AMG, the highest tier of the C-Class premium division from Mercedes, the cream of the crop, and their contender against the likes of the BMW 335i Coupe and the Audi S4. It is part of a newer generation of Benz, a generation aiming to claim 2nd spot overall, in the premium brand division, from Audi by 2015. So how does this coupe compare to its rival countrymen? How does it compare to the \u201cSheer Driving Pleasure\u201d of BMW and the Vorsprung Durch Technik of the Audi?\n \nWell, from a looks point of view, it\u2019s quite stunning, a definite FHM model amongst the pack, sleek lines, strong curves, and just the right amount of shape on the wheel arches give this coupe a sex appeal that very few can argue. The long bonnet and short rear add sportiness to the overall looks, and the Avant-Garde styling of the front grill and headlights give the C350 Coupe a fierce presence on the road. The standard 7 spoke 17\u201d alloys are nothing spectacular, but the 18\u201d AMG double spoke alloys are available as an extra. The body kit is standard on this model as the AMG styling package, but adding the panoramic sunroof puts the cherry on top of the class leading exterior design. From front to back, this car is stunning, and the symmetrical twin exhausts put the finishing touches on a backside that would make any supermodel develop a complex\n \nOpen the driver\u2019s door and enter the cockpit, and what awaits is nothing but pure luxury. This demo model is fully kitted out, fitted with the \u201cPiano White Trimmings\u201d with white door inserts as opposed to the stainless steel inserts, and white leather trim in the steering wheel. It also features SatNav, reverse camera, park distance sensors, AMG Package (which includes paddles behind the steering wheel), and panoramic sunroof, to name a few of the additional extras. The Piano White trim is exceptional and genuinely classy, a 50\u2019s big band feel, like Frank Sinatra himself had personally designed the interior of your Mercedes. The leather seats come standard as electrical, with the option of heated and memory seats. The leather is soft, yet high quality and durable, and the shape of the seat offers support and comfort in perfect moderation.\n \nPress the brake in and turn the key, and the 3.5 litre V6 comes to life with a low growl. Shift into gear (unfortunately this car only comes in an automatic) and release the handbrake and it\u2019s time to get moving. The car accelerates smoothly from standstill, and the car feels light and nimble driving around town. You feel a certain gracefulness piloting the car, a refined class, as if you\u2019re a cut above the rest of those around you. The steering is responsive, smooth, and precise, the wheel flows smoothly and sits comfortably in your hands, but gives the impression that you could steer with one finger with the greatest of ease. The gear changes are seamless from the 7 speed auto box, and the car oozes grace. But from a 3.5 litre V6, what you really want to do is get out on the highway and see what she can do\u2026\n \nAs the highway onramp looms, anticipation builds, elegant sophistication makes way for childish ambition. The lanes open from one into four, and the lead in your right foot grows heavier. Your fingertips stretch out behind the wheel for the flappy paddles, and your ears prick up with excitement. The V6 growls a little louder, and grows into a vicious growl; the rev counter rises steadily, as does the speedometer, and as the rev counter reaches its peak before redline at 6500 RPM, your right hand instinctively twitches, shifting gear with minimal effort. The change is seamless, and surprisingly enough instantaneous! The acceleration is flawless, and every time you shift up, you\u2019re awestruck by the fluidity and swiftness of the gear changes. Speed comes naturally when you\u2019re piloting this piece of art, and at every second you feel engaged with the car, as if it was programmed using your very own brain as a blueprint. The speedometer climbs past 200 with effortless ease, cars flying past as if they\u2019re merely standing still, and yet the Merc remains steady and its balance perfect. The odd slow moving car ahead is dealt with simply by turning the wheel an inch to the left and back again, steering response being one of the C350 Coupe\u2019s strongest attributes.\n \nWeaving between traffic is a breeze, even at high speeds, and it\u2019s an almost effortless exercise to accelerate between small gaps. When that extra burst is needed, a tap of your left hand on the paddle prompts an instant downshift and a massive upsurge in torque. The engine shouts, and the car leaps ahead with vigour and excitement. It\u2019s phenomenal how quickly the automatic gearbox follows instruction, without the slightest bit of hesitation. The sound of the engine when you downshift almost taunts you to accelerate harder, pushes you to do more, and before long, you\u2019ve reached the top speed, limited to 250km/hr by Mercedes. The car cold easily handle more, that isn\u2019t even a question, but does it handle slowing down as well as it handles speed?\n \nA slight push of the brake pedal confirms that it handles slowing down as well, if not better, than it does speed, and in no time, the dial reads a leisurely 120km/hr. The rate at which the C350 Coupe decelerates and the comfort it maintains while doing so is yet another confirmation of its suave, classy engineering, engineering not only for your enjoyment, but for your safety and comfort too. By the time you decide to accelerate again, the gearbox has already selected the right gear and you\u2019re swiftly back up to pace. Acceleration from 120-180 is astoundingly quick, and the overall feel you get is that the car will accomplish any 100km/hr acceleration gap in half the time it takes to get from standstill to 100 (6 seconds flat).\n \nI must admit, I\u2019ve never experienced an automatic gearbox as fluid and efficient as this one. The shifts are seamless, and the response time is too short for you to even notice. The power delivery in each gear is immense, and due to the fact that it\u2019s a naturally aspirated engine, there\u2019s no worry of turbo lag, and the sound is pure and distinguishable. The car has all the grace of a ballroom dancer at any given moment of the drive, yet it has the power of an Olympic athlete ready to be unleashed with the push of the accelerator.\n \nIn the battle of the German big 3, comparisons will always be made, and after driving all three, I feel it\u2019s only fair to give my opinion. The BMW 335i Coupe has an exterior design second to none, however the interior lets it down, and there\u2019s a detached feel in the drive, not to mention the turbo lag being a bit of a let down. The Audi S4 is the blandest looking overall, both inside and out, although the high power engine, minimal turbo lag, and Quattro all wheel drive are huge benefits, but it feels too cold, too clinical, no fun at all! The Mercedes Benz C350 Coupe however offers stunning exterior looks, stylish interior looks and feel, high performance, great sound, engaging drive, and a flappy paddle gearbox so brilliant it rivals even the best of manuals. Basically, the BMW is a beautiful bicycle which does well where it needs to, and the Audi still has training wheels on so you never feel that adrenaline rush of tipping slightly too much. But the Merc is a streamlined racing bike, offering speed, handling, beauty, and thrill in one complete package, tuned to your exact brainwaves, designed to do your bidding. Out of the three big Germans; this time, Mercedes Benz takes the cake by a long shot!\n \nOh, and did I mention I\u2019m a Beemer fan?\n\nArticle written by: Roger Biermann.",

          "Ik ben in het bezit van een Mercedes CLK-200. Bouwjaar 2000. Kenteken 01-FL-LJ\n\nVrijdag 29 april 2016 is de rechter draagarm van mijn Mercedes afgebroken, terwijl ik met 30 km p/u in een woonwijk reed. Vlak daarvoor reed ik nog op de snelweg, dus gelukkig kan ik dit nog navertellen. \n\nDe ANWB heeft mijn Mercedes weggesleept naar een garage. Eenmaal bij de garage aangekomen, bleek dat de binnenkant van de originele draagarm zo ver is geroest dat het onderdeel uiteindelijk afgebroken is. Dit gaat om het deel dat afgesloten is, dus de binnenkant van de draagarm. \n\nIk ben bij enkele garages langsgeweest met de draagarm van mijn Mercedes voor een second opinion. Bij het zien van de draagarm schrokken alle garagehouders van het auto-onderdeel. Twee konden hun ogen niet geloven. Als dit een paar uur eerder was gebeurd, dan kon ik dit niet navertellen.\n\nNa de geschrokken reacties van de garages ben ik bij Mercedes dealer ROGAM in Rotterdam langsgeweest. Zij hebben voor mij een offici\u00eble klacht ingediend bij de fabrikant. De klacht is afgewezen voor vergoeding, omdat de Mercedes fabrikant schrijft dat de 16 jaar oude draagarm niet onder de garantie valt. \n\nAls mijn draagarm op de snelweg was afgebroken, dan had ik niet alleen mezelf maar ook eventuele omstanders in gevaar gebracht. Op deze manier rij ik nog liever in een BMW of Audi, aangezien Mercedes niet de veiligheid weet te leveren die jullie beloven.\n\nDat brengt mij bij deze punten:\n- Hoe kan een draagarm van binnen roesten?\n- Hoe kan een draagarm afbreken bij een Mercedes?\n- Hoe kan een betrouwbare autofabrikant als Mercedes dit afwijzen?\n- Moeten er doden of gewonden vallen voordat men deze fout erkent?\n- Hoe weet ik zeker dat de draagarmen van deze Mercedes of van een eventuele andere Mercedes het niet weer begeven?\n\nOnur Yilmaz.",

          "Estimados se\u00f1ores de Mercedes-Benz,les escribo estas l\u00edneas para demostrarles mi mas absoluta indignacion con ustedes\nPaso a explicar mi caso:\nEn febrero del 2013 compre un serie E-220CDI en el concesionario oficial d\u00e9 Mercedes en Leipzig (Alemania) el coche ten\u00eda 10 meses de antig\u00fcedad y unos 22500km(ahora no recuerdo el n\u00famero exacto) y lo matricule como en taxi en Bilbao (mi profesi\u00f3n y ciudad natal)\nEl coche funcionaba sin problemas hasta octubre del a\u00f1o pasado que rompi\u00f3 la caja de v\u00e1lvulas del cambio,el coche ten\u00eda 110.000km\nMe lo repararon en el taller oficial Berasategui de Derio y cual fue mi asombro que se hicieron cargo del 75%de la reparaci\u00f3n aunque el veh\u00edculo estaba ya fuera de garant\u00eda,pero hay empez\u00f3 mi quebradero de cabeza\nEl coche sali\u00f3 con una vibraci\u00f3n en la P y en la N de la caja cambios\nAcud\u00ed al taller de Berasategui en 2 ocasiones para comentar el problema y me dijeron que pod\u00eda ser del intercambiador de par pero que no estaban seguros y que siguiera andando con el veh\u00edculo porque igual lo cambiaba y no era de ah\u00ed,que no pod\u00edan hacer una consulta a Madrid porque el coche no daba ning\u00fan error en el ordenador\nComo no quede conforme volv\u00ed en otras 2 ocasiones a dicho taller y en una ocasi\u00f3n me cambiaron un taco de la caja y en la segunda 2 tacos del motor,pero la vibraci\u00f3n persist\u00eda\nPues bien,5 meses despu\u00e9s,el 16-3-15 el coche me dejo tirado,y volv\u00ed a Berasategui donde me dijero que era del intercambiador de par\nDespu\u00e9s de cambiarlo me dicen que no era de ah\u00ed que han hecho varias consultas y es de la caja de cambios\nMe dan 3 opciones:\n1-abrir la caja la cual me dicen que no saben lo que se van a encontrar\n2-cambiar la caja por una recuperada\n3-cambiar las 2 partes de la caja de v\u00e1lvulas a ver si es de ah\u00ed,vamos que no lo sab\u00edan con certeza\nMe decline por cambiar la caja por una recuperada ya que es la opci\u00f3n que mas garant\u00edas me daban de quedar bien el coche\nHe hablado con atenci\u00f3n al cliente para ver si mercedes se hac\u00eda cargo de algo de parte de la reparaci\u00f3n que asciende s la friolera de 6705\u20ac y me lo han denegado\nAhora me pregunto yo,porque me tengo que hacer cargo del total de una reparaci\u00f3n por un mal diagn\u00f3stico inicial?\nDe que sirve ir a pasar todas las revisiones al taller oficial si luego la marca te deja tirado?\nEstos son los standartes de calidad de Mercedes,una caja que dura 128.000km?\nEste es el tacto comercial con sus clientes? Cuando esta claro que es una pieza que ha venido defectuosa de fabrica\nEn fin,tengo de hacer lo mas p\u00fablico mi caso posible,poniendo hojas en mi taxi dando a conocer mi caso con esta marca y que la gente valore,as\u00ed como mandarlo a todas las revistas del motor que se quieran hacer eco,porque me siento totalmente indignado con ustedes\nMe pensare muy mucho comprar otro mercedes\nSin otro part\u00edculas,no les puedo dar las gracias porque no se las merecen\nAdi\u00f3s\nFdo:Igor Etxabe.",
