          "Brewed as a Munchen Dunkel, this style is considered the traditional beer of Munich and can be found in taverns throughout the city and region. Most beers brewed in this style can be described as having a toasted or chocolate flavor with low bitterness and little hop aroma. Each brewery, however, takes creative license in crafting their own beer by varying the color, malt, and hopping rate. The Harpoon Brewery is no exception.\n \nBEER CHARACTER\n\nA blend of specialty malts gives this beer a velvety mouthfeel with roasted notes and a hint of chocolate, balanced by a subtle hop aroma. Hard to describe but easy to drink, Harpoon Dark is rich in character and light on the palate.\n \nThe overall character is rich malt and chocolate balanced with a crisp hop bitterness.\n \n  \nAVAILABILITY - Year Round\n\nDark has been a favorite of ours since we first brewed it in 1998, but it hasn\u2019t always been easy to find outside of the Brewery.

The original version of this beer was brewed in the winter of 2009 by Harpoon Vermont sales representative John Baker.\n \nHarpoon brewer Brett Simmons based his 2012 version on John\u2019s recipe, with some tweaks to make it his own. It is brewed with a combination of wheat malt, pale malt, caramel malt, and mildly hopped with Willamette. The balance of malts and hops allows the distinct flavor and aroma of real Vermont maple syrup to take the lead.\n \nThe pure Vermont maple syrup used in the beer came from Baker Farm in East Dummerston\u2014the family farm of John Baker\u2014and Scrag Mountain Sugar House in Waitsfield. The maple sweetness and body that blankets this velvety amber beer showcases one of New England\u2019s most beloved traditions.\n \nBrewed on: 2/23/12\nPackaged on: 3/8/12\n \nBREWED BY\nHarpoon Brewer Brett Simmons\n \nAVAILABLE FROM \nMarch 2012 to ....\nTHE LABEL\n\n  \nFOOD PAIRING SUGGESTIONS\npork tenderloin, barbecue, cr\u00e8me brulee, and vanilla ice cream topped with warm Vermont maple syrup\nBEER SPECIFICATIONS \nStyle:\nWheat Ale\t\nOriginal Gravity:\n15.6\nAlcohol by Volume: (ABV)\n6.8% \nIBU\u2019S:\n21\nColor:\t40.

Flaked barley is also used in the malt bill for head retention. An intense yet diverse hop addition schedule is executed during the boil that results in a well balanced offering.\r\n \r\nOn top of the Chinook, Simcoe, Cascade, and Citra hops is an ample addition of Ahtanum hops that provides a fruity aroma to complement the earthy, spicy bitterness of this dark ale.\r\n \r\nBrewed on: 12/15/11\r\nPackaged on: 1/5/12 \r\n \r\nBREWED BY\r\nHarpoon Brewer Matt Deluca\r\n \r\nAVAILABLE FROM \r\nJanuary 2012 to ....
