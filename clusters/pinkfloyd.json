Hosted by DJ Matt Everitt, the event started with a short description of the exhibition by co-curator Victoria Broackes, outlining the attention to detail that has gone into every aspect. \n\nThis was followed by a Question & Answer session with Matt and Pink Floyd\u2019s Creative Director Aubrey \u2018Po\u2019 Powell of Hipgnosis, alongside Ray Winkler, CEO of the exhibition\u2019s designers Stufish. Po spoke evocatively and warmly of his personal history with the members of Pink Floyd, and with Syd Barrett in particular, providing a creative and cultural overview of the ups, downs and importance of Pink Floyd\u2019s career, while Ray Winkler touched on the design and architectural elements of Pink Floyd\u2019s live staging.\n\nDaniel Sennheiser, CEO of audio electronics company Sennheiser, then talked about the company's involvement with Pink Floyd from their earliest years, and their shared commitment to audio excellence, which will manifest itself in 360-degree audio mixes played in a portion of the exhibition, as well as the headphone technology used to provide aural accompaniment to the exhibits.\n\nFinally, Roger and Nick took to the stage to answer questions from Matt Everitt and some media in the audience. With thoughtful, and occasionally hilarious, answers, they covered topics such as playing specific concerts and Roger\u2019s forthcoming album, to be entitled \u2018Is This The Life We Really Want?\u2019, while Nick admitted that he was probably the member of Pink Floyd most likely to have kept photos and memorabilia. Both of them professed their admiration for the V&A curation team in unearthing interesting and meaningful objects, whether historic personal letters from the band or the actual cane used to beat Roger at Cambridgeshire High School For Boys, accompanied by the school\u2019s \u2018Punishment Book\u2019 listing the beatings. \n\nThey both looked forward to viewing the exhibition in person, including passing through the entrance, a special reconstruction of the band\u2019s Bedford CA van, into a world of Pink Floyd history, starting with psychedelia and progressing to the ambitious stagings of the later years.\n\nThe Pink Floyd Exhibition: Their Mortal Remains, presented by the V&A and Michael Cohl\u2019s Iconic Entertainment Studios, runs from the 13th May till the 1st October 2017.\n\nTickets are on sale now: in person at the V&A; online at vam.ac.uk/pink-floyd or by calling (In the UK ) 0800 912 6961 (booking fee applies); or from ticketing partners Ticketmaster, LOVETheatre, See Tickets and Encore\n\nwww.pinkfloydexhibition.com | vam.ac.uk/pink-floyd | #TheirMortalRemains.

The play also ranges over a series of grand themes, which are both thought provoking and laced with Stoppard\u2019s characteristic wit and humour.

The six individual collections were first released as part of 'The Early Years 1965-1972' box set, but will now be available as bite-sized volumes broken down by years 1965-1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971 and finally 1972. Outtakes and demos from the band's early albums are included alongside live versions, as well as radio sessions and television appearances, on these packages.\n\nThe titles of each package (CAMBRIDGE ST/ATION, GERMIN/ATION, DRAMATIS/ATION, DEVI/ATION, REVERBER/ATION, OBFUSC/ATION) were dreamt up by Roger Waters to give an insight into where the band were at that particular point in their career.\n\n'The Early Years: Individual Volumes' give fans the opportunity to hear the evolution of the band and witness their part in the cultural revolution from their earliest recordings and studio sessions to the years prior to the release of 'The Dark Side Of The Moon'.\n\nFor fans wishing to immerse themselves in the full Pink Floyd story, the complete box set 'The Early Years: 1965-1972' is still available, and collates all of the individual volumes plus extra discs, collectables and memorabilia exclusive to the box set. In addition to the individual volumes and the deluxe set, a 2-CD highlights album 'The Early Years \u2013 CRE/ATION' is also available.\n\nFor more details and to order, visit http://smarturl.it/TEY.

Polly read an extract from \u2018The Kindness\u2019 and then Damian, who is a charming, witty and erudite interlocutor, asked her about the novel, its genesis and her unique approach to writing. The audience, which included fellow authors Jon Ronson (\u2018The Psychopath Test) and Neil Gaiman (\u2018The Sandman\u2019) were clearly captivated by Polly\u2019s eloquent and humourous account of her writing life and the challenges \u2018The Kindness\u2019 presented, some involving looking a sperm under a microscope: to understand this reference, read the book.\n\nJoining Damian next was Jonathan Lee, a British, New York-based writer, who is best known for his novels \u2018Who Is Mr Satoshi\u2019, \u2018Joy\u2019, and his new book, \u2018High Dive\u2019 \u2013 the Guardian newspaper described him as \u2018a major new voice in British fiction.\u2019  Jonathan read an extract from \u2018High Dive\u2019 which is based on events prior to the bombing of The Grand Hotel in Brighton. Coincidentally, Polly\u2019s book of short stories \u2018Perfect Lives\u2019 is also set in Brighton.\n\nDamian\u2019s final session was with David and Polly, discussing their very successful music writing partnership.  Invariably David will play Polly several pieces of music and she will see where her lyrical muse takes her; she explained that she listens to the music on her iPod and walks miles mulling it over and writing in her head.  Damian asked if there were ever occasions when David rejected the lyrics and he replied \u2018only once\u2019, most of the time they are \u2018perfect\u2019. It was a good note to end on.",

Polly spoke about The Kindness with David Ulin before being joined by David Gilmour, where they talked about their chart topping writing collaborations: four number one albums so far.  The event filled the shop to capacity and the signing line took a couple of hour to complete; the bookstore was delighted.  \n\nThe second event took place a week later, on the other side of this vast North American continent, in Toronto.  Ben McNally Books hosted the event in their charming art deco book shop, and Ben was the interviewer.   Following Polly\u2019s reading of an extract from The Kindness, Ben asked her about where the story had come from and about her writing process. He commented that \u201cit is a tremendous book and you are a brilliant writer.\u201d  Talking about her writing process, Polly said that for her it\u2019s not about \u201cgetting your bottom on a seat,  it\u2019s about getting on your feet\u201d as she explained that she walks for miles \u2018writing\u2019 in her head, both her prose and lyrics.

Chosen from 50 records nominated by a panel of highly respected music design experts and previous Best Art Vinyl Award winners, the covers demonstrate a complete range of creative disciplines, including traditional fine art, photography, sculpture and computer graphics. \n\nThe concept and production for David Gilmour's cover was created by The Creative Corporation, art directed by Dave Stansbie in collaboration with Aubrey 'Po' Powell from the legendary Hipgnosis design studio, who produced album covers for Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, 10cc and many others during the 60's, 70's and 80's.\n\nDavid Gilmour said: \"I am thrilled that the artwork to Rattle That Lock has received the ArtVinyl award. I'd like to offer my congratulations and thanks to Dave Stansbie and the team at The Creative Corporation for the brilliant work that they have done for me. It's a thrill to see vinyl making a comeback and the return of the opportunities that the larger format offers. Thanks again\".\n\nBest Art Vinyl founder Andrew Heeps explains, \"This is the first year such an established artist's record has won Best Art Vinyl, but notably the design team have historically been responsible for so many iconic sleeve designs and their talent and creativity to match the musicians' wishes clearly shone through. It's interesting that two of the top three are conceptual compositions, using photography as the core of the design and all three use digital design skills to great effect, showing that designers are using all tools available to them throughout the creative process. We believe this is a unique art prize that really taps into popular culture, as the created artwork is used to not just sell the product but to enhance the listeners' overall experience.\"\n\nIn January 2016, the winners of the Best Art Vinyl 2015 award will feature in exhibitions in London, Scotland, Italy, Germany and Hungary as well as on www.artvinyl.com.

          "DAVID GILMOUR AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL IN AID OF TEENAGE CANCER TRUST \u2013  Sunday 24 April\n\nLast night David Gilmour and his band were delighted to perform a concert in aid of Teenage Cancer Trust, the last performance in nearly a week of shows for this incredible charity. The concert was the same production and set that David has been successfully touring since last Summer, most recently in the States.\n\nDuring the afternoon David and some of the band attended a music workshop to listen to two songs, \u2018Spreading Love\u2019 and \u2018Hope Is the Key\u2019 which the young people had written during the three hour workshop in the style of David Gilmour. The tracks were brilliant and the ovation was very well deserved. Barrie Knight, David\u2019s head of security for over 20 years, has worked with TCT on all their 16 Royal Albert Hall fundraisers, and he also got a rousing vote of thanks.\n\nTeenage Cancer Trust\u2019s fundraising concert series at the Royal Albert Hall began in 2000 with a concert by The Who and Friends, and Roger Daltrey is the charity\u2019s Honorary Patron. Through the proceeds raised by the concerts and the publicity created, Teenage Cancer Trust has created 28 specialist TCT units across the UK and currently funds 63 teenage cancer specialists.\n\nThe set list for last night\u2019s concert was the same as Madison Square Garden but with one notable difference: during the \u2018Comfortably Numb\u2019 finale David and the band segued into a brief rendition of the solo from \u2018Purple Rain\u2019 as a tribute to Prince.\n\nIt was another remarkable concert from David, with many fans visibly moved. He signed off with some words of support for the Teenage Cancer Trust. Next stop, Europe.\n\nSET LIST:\nFirst half: 5am, Rattle That Lock, Faces Of Stone, Wish You Were Here, What Do You Want From Me, A Boat Lies Waiting, The Blue, Money, Us And Them, In Any Tongue, High Hopes.\nSecond half: Astronomy Domine, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Fat Old Sun, Coming Back To Life, The Girl In The Yellow Dress, Today, Sorrow, Run Like Hell.\nEncore: Time/Breathe(rep), Comfortably Numb.",

Somehow it seems longer; time has a habit of standing still on tour. The concerts have been an unmitigated success with David and the band scaling the heights of musical excellence, garnering rave reviews, drawing wonderful audiences who clearly loved every minute and evoking emotions in the fans that perhaps took them by surprise, such is the power of great music.\n\nDavid, having turned 70 this year, seems to have found another gear. This was his third concert in a row and he showed no signs of flagging; quite the reverse. He would be the first to acknowledge that he may be the maestro but he couldn\u2019t do what he does without a huge team effort from both his nine-piece band and his crew.  \n\nSo with this the final post of the North American tour, thank you and take a bow:\nDavid Gilmour, Phil Manzanera, Jon Carin, Guy Pratt, Steve DiStanislao, Kevin McAlea, Joao Mello, Bryan Chambers, Louise Marshall and Lucita Jules.\n\n\u2018The time is gone, the song is over\u2019\n\nSET LIST:\nFirst half: 5am, Rattle That Lock, Faces Of Stone, Wish You Were Here, What Do You Want From Me, A Boat Lies Waiting, The Blue, Money, Us And Them, In Any Tongue, High Hopes.\nSecond half: Astronomy Domine, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Fat Old Sun, Coming Back To Life, The Girl In The Yellow Dress, Today, Sorrow, Run Like Hell.\nEncore: Time/Breathe(rep), Comfortably Numb.",

Located in midtown Manhattan, this 18,000 capacity venue, sits on top of the equally famous Pennsylvania station. During David Gilmour's soundcheck there was a palpable feeling of excitement that perhaps the night would be one of those special ones.\n\nWhen David and the band walked on the stage, the audience gave them a standing ovation and that set the tone for the night. Not since South America has \u2018Wish You Were Here\u2019 been sung with such gusto. They roared, they cheered, they chanted \u2018David\u2019 and the band responded, led by the maestro, \u2018knocking it out the park\u2019 on every track.\n\nFor the many guitar fans in the audience, Marc Brickman, projects many shots of David\u2019s \u2018wide\u2019 fingers bending and pushing the strings with bewildering accuracy. It also shows close-ups of his famous guitars to good effect, with the trusty black Strat taking a lot of the electric load.\n\nStevie di Stanislao\u2019s drumming is rock solid, propelling the band forward and giving David a powerful beat to play off. There is a saying that \u2018a band is only as good as its drummer\u2019, but perhaps a drummer said that.  When there are close-ups of Stevie on the screen it is clear what a physical, as well as musical job, the drummer has\u2026luckily Stevie is a gentle giant.\n\nThe film that accompanies the every popular \u2018High Hopes\u2019 is set in David\u2019s home city of Cambridge and features the famous University, where his father was a college lecturer. The point where the giant University scarves are released has been cheered throughout the \u2018Rattle That Lock\u2019 tour.\n\nAs the end of this magnificent concert David thanked the audience and said \u201cI hope you all had as good a time as I have.\u201d\n\nSET LIST:\nFirst half: 5am, Rattle That Lock, Faces Of Stone, Wish You Were Here, What Do You Want From Me, A Boat Lies Waiting, The Blue, Money, Us And Them, In Any Tongue, High Hopes\nSecond half: Astronomy Domine, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Fat Old Sun, Coming Back To Life, The Girl In The Yellow Dress, Today, Sorrow, Run Like Hell\nEncore: Time/Breathe(rep), Comfortably Numb.",

This 6,000 seater iconic venue, built in the Art Deco style, opened in 1932 and still features the famous annual Christmas Spectacular with The Rockettes.  Steve di Stanislao, the band\u2019s drummer, causally mentioned that his Grandma did a stint as a Rockette: impressive grandma credentials Stevie.\n\nThere were quite a few latecomers and it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that the concert does start at 8pm.  \n\nThe watery couplet of \u2018A Boat Lies Waiting\u2019 and \u2018The Blue\u2019 worked beautifully in this intimate and grand theatre, with its apricot velvet seats and gold drapes adorning the proscenium arch.\n\nThe sound of cash registers drew a roar of recognition followed by the famous bass riff, as \u2018Money\u2019 got underway in all its musical greatness.  This was followed by \u2018Us and Them\u2019, a Waters/Wright composition and another track from \u2018The Dark Side of The Moon\u2019. The \u2018Us and Them\u2019 film, show on the giant circular screen, opens with a grey, London day and then cuts to New York, and aerial views of the skyscraper city, perhaps including this venue.\n\nLouise Marshall, Lucita Jules and Bryan Chambers, \u2018the glorious singers\u2019, make a huge impact with not only their singing but their synchronized dance moves; during the \u2018Shine On\u2019 sax solo they mirrored Joao\u2019s fingers on the keys.\n\nDavid\u2019s virtuoso playing during \u2018Sorrow\u2019 drew a standing ovation, and the audience remained on their feet for the encore of Time/ Breathe and Comfortably Numb.  As David and the band took their final bow, he told them \u2018You\u2019ve been a great New York audience\u2019.

Before each concert there is a series of sound effects which have various Pink Floyd references, a plane flying overhead, the sound of a helicopter, birds song, a man talking: some may notice, others are too caught up in the anticipation of the concert, cheering the movement of the guitar techs as they do their final tuning.\n\nTonight the fans were on their feet from the start, cheering and roaring on every song, and giving a warm round of applause to Joao Mello\u2019s terrific sax solo in \u2018Us and Them\u2019.\n\nIn the audience were Richard Wright\u2019s daughter, son and grandson; he is sorely missed and remembered by the song, \u2018A Boat Lies Waiting\u2019, which features Richard\u2019s spoken voice.\n\nSteve di Stanislao was again magnificent on drums, powering the band along and his striking of the bell at the beginning of \u2018High Hopes\u2019 is always a concert highlight.\n\nThe lasers during \u2018Comfortably Numb\u2019 ratchet up the excitement, matching David\u2019s soloing and providing powerful visual images to accompany one of the most iconic guitar solos in rock history.\n\nThe band took their final bow and it was time to leave Chicago and head for the final stage of the tour, New York.  Chicago had one final surprise as the band exited the venue: three inches of snow had fallen during the concert.\n\nFor the 48-strong crew it was three hours more hard work, breaking the set down, loading the seven trucks and driving the 790 miles, through the night, to New York.\n\nThe set list had an extra song with the inclusion of \u2018On An Island.\u2019\n\nSET LIST:\nFirst half: 5am, Rattle That Lock, Faces Of Stone, Wish You Were Here, What Do You Want From Me, A Boat Lies Waiting, The Blue, Money, Us And Them, In Any Tongue, High Hopes.\nSecond half: Astronomy Domine, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Fat Old Sun, Coming Back To Life, On An Island, The Girl In The Yellow Dress, Today, Sorrow, Run Like Hell.\nEncore: Time/Breathe(rep), Comfortably Numb.",

          "The Auditorium Theatre, Chicago, 6 April\n\nFaced with a three day gap between the two mammoth concerts at The United Center, David Gilmour suggested bridging it with a concert at the city\u2019s historic The Auditorium Theatre.  This meant that the magnificent crew, led by Phil Taylor and Roger Searle, had to load out of The United Center and somehow make all the gear fit into the small theatre and then return it to the arena for Friday\u2019s concert: the screen along weighs 6 tons.  \n\nDavid last played this small 3,800 seater with Pink Floyd in April 1972, 44 years ago, but he wasn\u2019t the only one returning to an old haunt, as bandmate Phil Manzanera played there with Roxy Music in 1975.\n\nThis architectural gem of a theatre was completed in 1889 and became the tallest building in the city and the largest in the US, today it is on the National Register of Historic Places.  The ambition was to make it the world\u2019s grandest theatre to rival the Met in New York.  Arriving for soundcheck the beauty and elegance of the \u2018golden\u2019 auditorium was enchanting to behold, with its four ellipse-shaped arches directing sound outward to the audience.  \n\nThe opulence of the surroundings seemed to affect the audience, almost as much as what they were witnessing on stage, they were still, caught in the moment, watching David and the band  perform, and then after each song, roar into life.   It was another great performance, with the fans enjoying the Rattle that Lock songs as well as the Pink Floyd favourites.  The songs from the Division Bell album were cheered enthusiastically, with \u2018High Hopes\u2019 and \u2018Coming Back to Life\u2019.  During the barnstorming \u2018Run Like Hell\u2019 Guy Pratt showed that he can still run as fast as when he first performed the song aged 25.  \n\nThroughout the concert the sound was crystal clear, a combination of Colin Norfield\u2019s brilliance as a sound mixer and the wonderful acoustics of this fine building.  The concert of course was David\u2019s triumph but perhaps the venue shone just as brightly.\n\nSET LIST:\nFirst half: 5am, Rattle That Lock, Faces Of Stone, Wish You Were Here, What Do You Want From Me, A Boat Lies Waiting, The Blue, Money, Us And Them, In Any Tongue, High Hopes.\nSecond half: Astronomy Domine, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Fat Old Sun, Coming Back To Life, The Girl In The Yellow Dress, Today, Sorrow, Run Like Hell.\nEncore: Time/Breathe(rep), Comfortably Numb.",

Muddy Waters and Howlin\u2019 Wolf are just two of the Chicago singer/songwriters who significantly influenced many British rock musicians in the 60\u2019s, of which David Gilmour was one.\n\nEach night, during the concert, a guitar \u2018choreography\u2019 takes place, to which the audience is oblivious, and that\u2019s a mark of its success.  Phil Taylor (production director) and David\u2019s long-serving guitar tech has 16 guitar changes to make during the concert, Steve Prior, guitar tech to Phil Manzanera, has 14, and \u2018Alfie\u2019 Barton\u2019, Guy Pratt\u2019s bass tech, also has 14 changes: this constant activity on and off the stage invariably takes place in the dark or in blinding light, but such is the brilliance of Phil Taylor\u2019s \u2018choreography\u2019 that it is flawless\u2026and incident free.\n\nLast night\u2019s concert maintained the high standard of the tour, the audience loving every moment and David conjuring magic from the guitar and the voice.

The red and white circular venue, like the Bowl, has a famous history, best know as the home of the NBA Lakers until 1999.  It was designed in 1967 to evoke the forum in Rome, so while not quite as old as the amphiheatres David will be playing this Summer, it does fit the bill as a venue of 'special historic interest'. And nothing 'funny happened on the way'\u2026in fact the LA traffic was lighter than usual.\n\nTonight's set list was the same as Friday's concert again with the popular inclusion of What Do You Want From Me, a co-write from Gilmour, Wright and Samson. The singing of Bryan Chambers, Louise Marshall and Lucita Jules, is one of the many highlights of the evening, their soaring vocals and great moves catch the eye and the ear.\n\nThe 12,000 fans cheered and roared their approval throughout the evening both for the new songs and for the Pink Floyd evergreens. A Boat Lies Waiting is becoming a classic, the whole band come together and sing as a choir probably thinking of the great Richard Wright, who inspired this song. In Any Tongue received a standing ovation.\n\nOnce again Money proves to be a tour de force, with David taking new twists and turns with the solos and Joao Mello thrilling throughout the concert with his sax playing.\n\nIn British understatement David asked \"Are you having a reasonable time?\" and 12,000 voices shouted \"Yes\". He introduced the band, and local boy Steve di Stanislao, got an extra big cheer as did El Magnifico, Phil Manzanera.\n\nThe lasers during Comfortably Numb lit the domed roof of the forum making it look like a spacecraft about to land; perhaps there is somebody 'out there' after all.\n\nSet list:\nFirst half: 5am, Rattle That Lock, Faces Of Stone, Wish You Were Here, What Do You Want From Me, A Boat Lies Waiting, The Blue, Money, Us And Them, In Any Tongue, High Hopes.\nSecond half: Astronomy Domine, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Fat Old Sun, Coming Back To Life, The Girl In The Yellow Dress, Today, Sorrow, Run Like Hell.\nEncore: Time/Breathe(rep), Comfortably Numb.",

Tonight's performance of Money, accompanied by the images of money cascading down the front and sides of the Bowl, was probably one of the best ever, bringing the ecstatic audience to its feet.

Marc deployed 30 projectors to create stunning lighting effects using the dome as his canvas: Money had cascades of coins pouring down the sides of the bowl, Astronomy Domine was a psychedelic coloured bubble explosion and Run got even more crazy with coloured shapes running riot across the perimeter of this historic venue.  And then there were the spectacular fireworks, shooting out from the roof of the bowl; such was the power of the display that the clear night sky clouded over with the smoke.\n\nA further treat was in store for the Hollywood audience with the appearance of the great David Crosby, singing A Boat Lies Waiting, On An Island and Comfortably Numb.\n\nDavid and the band played a blinder but tonight, the show was equally about Marc Brickman's stunning and very beautiful lighting effects\u2026for one more night only.\n\nFirst set: 5 A.M., Rattle That Lock, Faces Of Stone, Wish You Were Here, A Boat Lies Waiting, The Blue, Money, Us And Them, In Any Tongue, High Hopes.\nSecond set: Astronomy Domine, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Fat Old Sun, Coming Back To Life, On An Island, The Girl In The Yellow Dress, Today, Sorrow, Run Like Hell\nEncore: Time / Breathe (reprise), Comfortably Numb.",

          "Home, home again... David Gilmour and his band returned to London's Royal Albert Hall this evening for the fourth of five concerts at the legendary venue.\n\nAs returns go, it was a stunning one. Picking up from where they left off, last Friday, the performance tonight was arguably the best so far in London. There were many highlights, such as the almost bluesy Money, an incredibly powerful In Any Tongue, and a storming Fat Old Sun which got the crowd on their feet. Comfortably Numb was a suitably epic end to a superb night.\n\nOne final show of David's 2015 European tour remains, tomorrow night in the same venue...if you are going to this, have a wonderful time.\n\nHere's what was played tonight:\n\nFirst set: 5am, Rattle That Lock, Faces Of Stone, Wish You Were Here, A Boat Lies Waiting, The Blue, Money, Us And Them, In Any Tongue, High Hopes.\nSecond set: Astronomy Domine, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Fat Old Sun, Coming Back To Life, On An Island, The Girl In The Yellow Dress, Today, Sorrow, Run Like Hell\nEncore: Time / Breathe (reprise), Comfortably Numb.",

          "Friday night in London, and the perfect end to the week with the third of David Gilmour's concerts at the Royal Albert Hall. With an attentive and rapt audience following every note avidly, the crowd were treated to a number of truly memorable moments.\n\nMost notably, David's son Gabriel Gilmour took to the stage to play his piano part on In Any Tongue to deserved applause, elevating the song to new highs along with the blistering solo from his father. \nThe guitar work in Money and High Hopes was also on another level tonight, with the band clearly \"in the groove\" with the set now.\n\nAstronomy Domine proved a fiery start to the second half, dazzling the crowd in more ways than one, and it was another older track - Fat Old Sun - which soon had the audience on their feet. From the new album, Today is proving another live favourite, and - as ever - Comfortably Numb is proving impossible to follow.\n\nHere's what was played last night:\n\nFirst set: 5am, Rattle That Lock, Faces Of Stone, Wish You Were Here, A Boat Lies Waiting, The Blue, Money, Us And Them, In Any Tongue, High Hopes.\nSecond set: Astronomy Domine, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Fat Old Sun, On An Island, The Girl In The Yellow Dress, Today, Sorrow, Run Like Hell\nEncore: Time / Breathe (reprise), Comfortably Numb.",

          "Well, how do you follow an incredible show such as last night's? With a show of such quality and power that the applause and cheering that met David Gilmour and his band raised the roof. \n\nAs performances go, it will be tough to better, with a band on fire and clearly enjoying every minute of the show. Particular mention must be made of the blistering solo in Money, although every song seemed to feature an energy to elevate.\n\nOf special note was that backing singer Louise Marshall celebrates her birthday today. A chorus of Happy Birthday from the crowd made up for the lack of unison with plenty of enthusiasm!\n\nHere's the set that was performed tonight:\nFirst set: 5am, Rattle That Lock, Faces Of Stone, Wish You Were Here, A Boat Lies Waiting, The Blue, Money, Us And Them, In Any Tongue, High Hopes.\nSecond set: Astronomy Domine, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Fat Old Sun, On An Island, The Girl In The Yellow Dress, Today, Sorrow, Run Like Hell\nEncore: Time / Breathe (reprise), Comfortably Numb.",

Last performing here in his own right nine years ago, the show thrilled the audience with superlative renditions of songs old and new.\n\nTo help make the opening show just that little bit more special, David's friends David Crosby and Graham Nash helped out on A Boat Lies Waiting, On An Island, and Comfortably Numb, which had the additional touch of lasers lighting up the Royal Albert Hall.

This seemed to focus fans even more on the music and the performances, with the crowd in Orange, France, giving particular praise to Fat Old Sun, Shine On, and Astronomy Domine, as well as In Any Tongue and Today from David's new album which got a particularly strong reception. With Colin Norfield, Sound Engineer, celebrating his birthday, this resulted in the crowd adding their own song to the set - singing Happy Birthday much to Colin's delight.\n\nHere's the set that was performed tonight:\n\nFirst set: 5am, Rattle That Lock, Faces Of Stone, Wish You Were Here, A Boat Lies Waiting, The Blue, Money, Us And Them, In Any Tongue, High Hopes.\nSecond set: Astronomy Domine, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Fat Old Sun, Coming Back To Life, On An Island, The Girl In The Yellow Dress, Today, Sorrow, Run Like Hell\nEncore: Time / Breathe (reprise), Comfortably Numb.",

          "This evening, David and his band played the Arena di Verona, a venue more used to hosting operas, which resulted in a stage with a quite different layout for the band and crew to get used to. There was a slight concern about the show, as the weather forecast was for thunder and lightning during the soundcheck, and concert too, but the storm that raged last night was replaced by sunnier weather today, resulting in a perfect night, and a great performance. The crowd's reaction to the music - old and new - was as electric as the threatened storm, and again the new tracks performed, in particular A Boat Lies Waiting, got an extremely enthusiastic reaction.\n\nAs before, for those wishing to avoid seeing what was performed, the setlist for tonight's show is at the end of this post.

For the sake of those who are yet to experience it, and don't want any surprises spoilt, we share the list of songs performed at the end of this post.\n\nThe sensational band were equalled only by the creations of Production/Lighting Designer Marc Brickman. Suffice to say that the screens, films and imaginative use of colour and staging made this a concert by which others should be judged.\n\n#DGBrighton First Set: 5am, Rattle That Lock, Faces Of Stone, Wish You Were Here, A Boat Lies Waiting, The Blue, Money, Us And Them, In Any Tongue, High Hopes.\nSecond set: Astronomy Domine, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, Fat Old Sun, On An Island, The Girl In The Yellow Dress, Today, Sorrow, Run Like Hell.\nEncores were Time / Breathe (reprise) and Comfortably Numb.",
