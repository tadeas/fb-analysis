We then blended it  (50:50) with some new spirit fully matured in quarter casks for 7 years and bottled it without any chill filtering for maximum flavour. It is at 51.2%ABV strength, which was one of the staff\u2019s ideas, so that the last 2 digits match the year of production .It\u2019s a fantastic \u2018coming of age\u2019 whisky, we hope you love it as much as we do! \r\n\r\nWill go on sale at our online shop W/C 18th June.\r\n\r\nTasting Notes.\r\nNose: With a nose that constantly evolves and is full of flavour Cairdeas Origin begins with a quick hint of concentrated orange moving quickly into huge peat flavours, ashy , dusty with hazelnut. It becomes crisp and fresh with cold green apples, grapes and finishing with a fresh cut grassy flavour.\r\n\r\nPalate: The flavours evolve slowly on the palate and with great body it begins with white pepper moving into an earthy peaty flavour, some slight salt then purple heather. Huge creamy apricots that last and last and it ends with some charred damp wood. Timeline Photos",

          "Islay Ales is the third of our Laphroaig Legacy Fund beneficiaries.\n\nIslay Ales is a small craft brewery producing a range of cask & bottle conditioned beers on the island. The business has been in continuous production since 2004 and whilst the majority of sales are on Islay, export has begun to France, Switzerland, Germany and Japan. It is the aim to continue this steady expansion of the business and increase the work force.\n\nTo achieve the increase in production, Islay Ales must have SALSA (Safe And Local Supplier Approval) accreditation, which is becoming a requirement of supermarkets and distributors. The Laphroaig Legacy Fund shall work alongside Islay Ales to fund the SALSA accreditation but also provide a training and development consultant. The combination of the accreditation matched with the training scheme shall not only see this small, family run business expand but will also generate employment opportunities for locals.\n\nFind out more at http://www.laphroaig.com/our-islay/legacy-fund/islay-ales.aspx Photos from Laphroaig's post",
