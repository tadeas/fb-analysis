We then blended it  (50:50) with some new spirit fully matured in quarter casks for 7 years and bottled it without any chill filtering for maximum flavour. It is at 51.2%ABV strength, which was one of the staff\u2019s ideas, so that the last 2 digits match the year of production .It\u2019s a fantastic \u2018coming of age\u2019 whisky, we hope you love it as much as we do! \r\n\r\nWill go on sale at our online shop W/C 18th June.\r\n\r\nTasting Notes.\r\nNose: With a nose that constantly evolves and is full of flavour Cairdeas Origin begins with a quick hint of concentrated orange moving quickly into huge peat flavours, ashy , dusty with hazelnut. It becomes crisp and fresh with cold green apples, grapes and finishing with a fresh cut grassy flavour.\r\n\r\nPalate: The flavours evolve slowly on the palate and with great body it begins with white pepper moving into an earthy peaty flavour, some slight salt then purple heather. Huge creamy apricots that last and last and it ends with some charred damp wood. Timeline Photos",

If you don\u2019t have moulds, line a 20 x 30cm baking tray with parchment paper.\n\nPour 130g of the whisky into a small saucepan and add the gelatine. Warm the pan over a low heat until the gelatine has dissolved in the liquid. Remove from the heat.\n\nPut the remaining whisky in a different saucepan with the glucose, caster sugar and cream of tartar. Place over a high heat and heat until the temperature of the liquid reaches 124\u00b0C / 255\u00b0F.\n\nRemove the pan from the heat and allow the liquid to cool to 100\u00b0C / 212\u00b0F before adding the whisky and gelatine mixture.\n\nMix the liquids together with a spatula until the gelatine is fully incorporated, then pour the mixture into the lightly greased moulds or onto the parchment-lined baking tray.\n\nPlace the moulds in the fridge and leave to set for at least 6 hours before de-moulding.\n\nCarefully remove the gums from the moulds, or cut the jelly on the tray into cubes. (You could also use a 1.5-2cm pastry cutter to cut out the gums.)\n\nOnce de-moulded, place the gums in a bowl with the granulated sugar and roll around until coated on all sides.\n\nOriginal recipe from: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/promotions/dine-home-heston/10616385/whisky-gums-heston.html Timeline Photos",

The business has been in continuous production since 2004 and whilst the majority of sales are on Islay, export has begun to France, Switzerland, Germany and Japan. It is the aim to continue this steady expansion of the business and increase the work force.\n\nTo achieve the increase in production, Islay Ales must have SALSA (Safe And Local Supplier Approval) accreditation, which is becoming a requirement of supermarkets and distributors.

The combination of the accreditation matched with the training scheme shall not only see this small, family run business expand but will also generate employment opportunities for locals.\n\nFind out more at http://www.laphroaig.com/our-islay/legacy-fund/islay-ales.aspx Photos from Laphroaig's post",
