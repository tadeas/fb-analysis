          "Removing extracellular amyloid as plaques in the brain does not cure #Alzheimer's disease. Yet new research suggests looking closer at amyloid inside the cells for future treatment. For Curing Alzheimer's Disease, It's Inside that Counts By: Michael D'Andrea, Posted on: March 7, 2016 What is the take-home message from the series of failed amyloid-based clinical trials? Simply stated, removing extracellular amyloid as plaques in the brain does not cure Alzheimer's disease. But before amyloid is taken off the list of targets to cure A...",

          "Dementia\nDementia is a collective term used to describe the problems that people with various underlying brain disorders or damage can have with their memory, language and thinking.Alzheimer's disease is the best known and most common disorder under the umbrella of dementia.\nDementia is not a single disease in itself, but a general term to describe symptoms such as impairments to memory, communication and thinking.1\nWhile the likelihood of having dementia increases with age, it is not a normal part of aging. Before we had today's understanding of specific disorders, \"going senile\" used to be a common phrase for dementia (\"senility\"), which misunderstood it as a standard part of getting old.\nLight cognitive impairments, by contrast, such as poorer short-term memory, can happen as a normal part of aging (we slowly start to lose brain cells as we age beyond our 20s3). This is known as age-related cognitive decline, not dementia, because it does not cause the person or the people around them any problems.\nDementia describes two or more types of symptom that are severe enough to affect daily activities.\nSymptoms that are classed as \"mild cognitive impairment\" - which, unlike cognitive decline, are not a normal part of aging - do not qualify as dementia either, since these symptoms are not severe enough.1 For some people though, this milder disease leads to dementia later on.4\ncauses dementia\nAll dementias are caused by brain cell death,1 and neurodegenerative disease - progressive brain cell death that happens over a course of time - is behind most dementias.4,6\n.But as well as progressive brain cell death like that seen in Alzheimer's disease, dementia can be caused by a head injury, a stroke or a brain tumor, among other causes.6\nSome of the causes are simpler to understand in terms of how they affect the brain and lead to dementia:1\n Vascular dementia - this results from brain cell death caused by conditions such as cerebrovascular disease, for example stroke. This prevents normal blood flow, depriving brain cells of oxygen.\n Injury - post-traumatic dementia is directly related to brain cell death caused by injury.\nSome types of traumatic brain injury - particularly if repetitive, such as received by sports players - have been linked to certain dementias appearing later in life. Evidence is weak, however, that a single brain injury will raise the likelihood of having a degenerative dementia such as Alzheimer's disease.7\nDementia can also be caused by:1,2,8\n Prion diseases - from certain types of protein, as in CJD (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) and GSS (Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome).\n HIV infection - when the problem is simply termed HIV-associated dementia. How the virus damages brain cells is not certain.\n Reversible factors - some dementias can be treated by reversing the effects of underlying causes, including medication interactions, depression, vitamin deficiencies (for example, thiamine/B1, leading to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which is most often caused by alcohol misuse), and thyroid abnormalities.\nsymptoms\nThe symptoms of dementia experienced by patients, or noticed by people close to them, are exactly the same signs that healthcare professionals look for. Therefore, detailed information on these is given in the next section about tests and diagnosis.\nA person with dementia may show any of the following problems, mostly due to memory loss - some of which they may notice (or become frustrated with) themselves, while others may only be picked up by carers or healthcare workers as a cause for concern. The signs used to compile this list are published by the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) in the journal American Family Physician:6\n Recent memory loss - a sign of this might be asking the same question repeatedly, forgetting about already asking it.\n Difficulty completing familiar tasks - for example, making a drink or cooking a meal, but forgetting and leaving it.\n Problems communicating - difficulty with language by forgetting simple words or using the wrong ones.\n Disorientation - with time and place, getting lost on a previously familiar street close to home, for example, and forgetting how they got there or would get home again.\n Poor judgment - the AAFP says: \"Even a well person might get distracted and forget to watch a child for a little while. People with dementia, however, might forget all about the child and just leave the house for the day.\"\n Problems with abstract thinking - for example, dealing with money.\n Misplacing things - including putting them in the wrong places and forgetting about doing this.\n Mood changes - unlike those we all have, swinging quickly through a set of moods.\n Personality changes - becoming irritable, suspicious or fearful, for example.\n Loss of initiative - showing less interest in starting something or going somewhere.\nTreatment\nBrain cell death cannot be reversed so there is no known treatment to cure a degenerative cause of dementia symptoms or fully halt its progress. Management of disorders such as Alzheimer's disease is instead focused on providing care and treating symptoms rather than their underlying cause.1,3\nIf dementia symptoms are due to a reversible, non-degenerative cause, however, treatment may be possible, to prevent or halt further brain tissue damage.1,3 Examples include injury, medication effects, vitamin deficiency.\nSymptoms of Alzheimer's disease can be reduced by drugs to help improve an individual's quality of life - there are four drugs in a class called cholinesterase inhibitor approved for this in the US:1\n Donepezil (brand name Aricept)\n Alantamine (Reminyl)\n Rivastigmine (Exelon)\n Tacrine (Cognex).\nA different kind of drug, memantine (Namenda), an \"NMDA receptor antagonist\", may also be used, alone or in combination with a cholinesterase inhibitor.1\nOther quality-of-life care\n\"Brain training\" can help in the early stages of Alzheimer's to improve cognitive functioning and help deal with forgetfulness. This might involve the use of mnemonics and other memory aids such as computerized recall devices.1\nOf course, care from healthcare professionals, and relatives to some extent, can help people with the later stages of dementia.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/clinical12psyc",
