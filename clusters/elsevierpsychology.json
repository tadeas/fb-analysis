          "Dementia\nDementia is a collective term used to describe the problems that people with various underlying brain disorders or damage can have with their memory, language and thinking.Alzheimer's disease is the best known and most common disorder under the umbrella of dementia.\nDementia is not a single disease in itself, but a general term to describe symptoms such as impairments to memory, communication and thinking.1\nWhile the likelihood of having dementia increases with age, it is not a normal part of aging. Before we had today's understanding of specific disorders, \"going senile\" used to be a common phrase for dementia (\"senility\"), which misunderstood it as a standard part of getting old.\nLight cognitive impairments, by contrast, such as poorer short-term memory, can happen as a normal part of aging (we slowly start to lose brain cells as we age beyond our 20s3). This is known as age-related cognitive decline, not dementia, because it does not cause the person or the people around them any problems.\nDementia describes two or more types of symptom that are severe enough to affect daily activities.\nSymptoms that are classed as \"mild cognitive impairment\" - which, unlike cognitive decline, are not a normal part of aging - do not qualify as dementia either, since these symptoms are not severe enough.1 For some people though, this milder disease leads to dementia later on.4\ncauses dementia\nAll dementias are caused by brain cell death,1 and neurodegenerative disease - progressive brain cell death that happens over a course of time - is behind most dementias.4,6\n.But as well as progressive brain cell death like that seen in Alzheimer's disease, dementia can be caused by a head injury, a stroke or a brain tumor, among other causes.6\nSome of the causes are simpler to understand in terms of how they affect the brain and lead to dementia:1\n Vascular dementia - this results from brain cell death caused by conditions such as cerebrovascular disease, for example stroke. This prevents normal blood flow, depriving brain cells of oxygen.\n Injury - post-traumatic dementia is directly related to brain cell death caused by injury.\nSome types of traumatic brain injury - particularly if repetitive, such as received by sports players - have been linked to certain dementias appearing later in life. Evidence is weak, however, that a single brain injury will raise the likelihood of having a degenerative dementia such as Alzheimer's disease.7\nDementia can also be caused by:1,2,8\n Prion diseases - from certain types of protein, as in CJD (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) and GSS (Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome).\n HIV infection - when the problem is simply termed HIV-associated dementia. How the virus damages brain cells is not certain.\n Reversible factors - some dementias can be treated by reversing the effects of underlying causes, including medication interactions, depression, vitamin deficiencies (for example, thiamine/B1, leading to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which is most often caused by alcohol misuse), and thyroid abnormalities.\nsymptoms\nThe symptoms of dementia experienced by patients, or noticed by people close to them, are exactly the same signs that healthcare professionals look for. Therefore, detailed information on these is given in the next section about tests and diagnosis.\nA person with dementia may show any of the following problems, mostly due to memory loss - some of which they may notice (or become frustrated with) themselves, while others may only be picked up by carers or healthcare workers as a cause for concern. The signs used to compile this list are published by the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) in the journal American Family Physician:6\n Recent memory loss - a sign of this might be asking the same question repeatedly, forgetting about already asking it.\n Difficulty completing familiar tasks - for example, making a drink or cooking a meal, but forgetting and leaving it.\n Problems communicating - difficulty with language by forgetting simple words or using the wrong ones.\n Disorientation - with time and place, getting lost on a previously familiar street close to home, for example, and forgetting how they got there or would get home again.\n Poor judgment - the AAFP says: \"Even a well person might get distracted and forget to watch a child for a little while. People with dementia, however, might forget all about the child and just leave the house for the day.\"\n Problems with abstract thinking - for example, dealing with money.\n Misplacing things - including putting them in the wrong places and forgetting about doing this.\n Mood changes - unlike those we all have, swinging quickly through a set of moods.\n Personality changes - becoming irritable, suspicious or fearful, for example.\n Loss of initiative - showing less interest in starting something or going somewhere.\nTreatment\nBrain cell death cannot be reversed so there is no known treatment to cure a degenerative cause of dementia symptoms or fully halt its progress. Management of disorders such as Alzheimer's disease is instead focused on providing care and treating symptoms rather than their underlying cause.1,3\nIf dementia symptoms are due to a reversible, non-degenerative cause, however, treatment may be possible, to prevent or halt further brain tissue damage.1,3 Examples include injury, medication effects, vitamin deficiency.\nSymptoms of Alzheimer's disease can be reduced by drugs to help improve an individual's quality of life - there are four drugs in a class called cholinesterase inhibitor approved for this in the US:1\n Donepezil (brand name Aricept)\n Alantamine (Reminyl)\n Rivastigmine (Exelon)\n Tacrine (Cognex).\nA different kind of drug, memantine (Namenda), an \"NMDA receptor antagonist\", may also be used, alone or in combination with a cholinesterase inhibitor.1\nOther quality-of-life care\n\"Brain training\" can help in the early stages of Alzheimer's to improve cognitive functioning and help deal with forgetfulness. This might involve the use of mnemonics and other memory aids such as computerized recall devices.1\nOf course, care from healthcare professionals, and relatives to some extent, can help people with the later stages of dementia.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/clinical12psyc",

          "I\u2019ve recently come up with a theory that I\u2019d like to share with you and hear your thoughts about. Scientists generally agree that our brains are wired to ensure our survival as a species and that the hormone dopamine drives the instinctual behaviours (eating, playing/practising skills, having sex) that guarantee our continued existence. Man is born with these instincts but another element also begins playing a role at birth: culture. The parent, typically the mother, automatically starts the upbringing of the child, for example: \"Ouch, don't bite me\" and \"No, you can't have that toy. It\u2019s Carl\u2019s\". Our reptilian brain controls the dopamine reward that pushes us to be the strongest, find the best spot and have the best tools, the best food and the best partner to survive. Our upbringing and the socialisation process, on the other hand, concerns restrictions and learning to obey the rules that allow us to be accepted in the group, tribe or society we are born into. Failing to obey leads to exclusion from the flock. Learning to adapt, however, leads to acceptance and love but also a rush of the hormone oxytocin. \nA familiar image has existed since ancient times of an angel at one ear and the devil at the other, their whisperings complicating our decision-making. If the angel represents our conscious thoughts, culturally acquired morals and ethics, then the devil symbolizes our reptilian brain and its displays of aggression, dominance and territoriality. Equating the reptilian brain with the devil is in fact wrong since it is crucial to our survival. At the same time, it\u2019s unavoidable that it puts us into dilemmas over and over again \u2013 especially in our bountiful, modern world. More and more people, for example, are becoming addicted to food, sex, games, social media, drugs and alcohol simply because it's possible to access them everywhere in modern society.\nInterestingly, studies show that genes linked to logical intelligence (centred mainly in the cerebral cortex), such as thinking, language and planning, are linked to the X chromosome. These genes are deactivated in the X chromosomes from the father but activated in the X chromosomes from the mother. Genes from the father dominate the limbic system responsible for sex, appetite and aggression. For more information on this topic, check out this article, which contains a list of exciting research (http://bit.ly/2cwx5ns).\nI\u2019ve always wondered why the left and right wing exist all over the world. And I think it might have to do with us being shaped in part by nature and in part by culture. The left wing focuses on making rules that support trust and solidarity among people (remember that we can all fall ill and end in poverty) while the right wing focuses on the individual\u2019s right to do as he or she likes to and on having fewer rules (innovation and conquering new ground is stifled by taxes and bureaucracy). Amusingly it reminds me a bit of a common conflict between men and women. The latter make rules for behaviour that men often see as a burden, which is why they like to escape on (hunting) trips with their buddies so they can act in a more natural or primitive way. More women in fact lean to the left, whereas men lean to the right. Though men and women are of course influenced by both nature and nurture, this tendency could be a remnant from the thousands of years women had the task of staying in the village and socialising and teaching the children while the men went hunting, a dynamic that emphasises their different interests and focus. If being rewarded by a rush of oxytocin is the reason we put up with restrictions, it might also be why we go as far as we do to belong to a group, even preferring something extreme or a band of criminals to being alone. \nCheck out this fascinating article on genes and political beliefs that links political beliefs to the role of dopamine (http://bit.ly/2cu2r8Z). It would be interesting to know whether oxytocin also plays a role ... And the question is whether political parties ought to acknowledge that neither side possess the whole truth \u2013 that they are handicapped without each other and that they better start cooperating in spite of wasting huge amounts of time and money starting civil wars.\nBodil Nissen\n\nThanks to Stig H\u00f8ybye-Olsen for the drawing of our split personalities.",

          "I am thrilled to find this review, written by the high-ranking Amazon reviewer and author of historical fiction books, Christoph Fischer. This is what he says about my trilogy, The David Chronicles:  \n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Great series December 20, 2014\nBy ChristophFischerBooks TOP 500 REVIEWER\n\n\"Rise to Power (The David Chronicles)\" by Uvi Poznansky is another eye opening book, based on a biblical theme but written with a modern mind and perspective. Without corrupting the original historic-biblical story Poznansky takes us into the world and minds of well known biblical figures, such as the first King of Israel, his rivals and his lovers.\nA man of flesh and blood, with sexual urges, pride and huge powers of reflection and analysis David is a superb character, real, with bite and of the human race - quite different from the biblical myth that has been created around him.\nWe see him as he slowly rises to power, from a small soldier to military leader, his military campaigns, his ambitions and the rivalry over the throne; we see the husband to Michal - his first wife and the sometimes strange 'renaissance' man. The novel is historical fiction, biblical fiction and simply excellent fiction.\n\u201cA Peek at Bathsheba\u201d by Uvi Poznansky is yet another one of her great Bible-inspired books. Nobody understands better to utilise existing stories that many of us are familiar with already \u2013 at least to some extent \u2013 and give them a new lease of life, a new angle and makes us see different sides to those historical, religious and mythical characters. Who was David really? A hero or a product of his circumstances, of coincidence and skilled manipulation?\n\u201cThe Edge of Revolt (The David Chronicles Book 3)\u201d by Author Uvi Poznansky is another amazing and spell binding book about the biblical King David. We meet him at a progressed age where his family life is turned upside down by the sexual escapes of his children, mainly that of his son Amnon.\nTo see his own reflection in the son who inherited the lust from David himself was one of the most extraordinary moments in reading this novel for me.\nSuch are the thoughtful illustrations of a well-known biblical character, modernised by language and brought to contemporary relevance. Humanised to flesh and blood we get to experience what often had the mere relevance as a myth, fable or saga. This is a powerful portrayal of the man behind the myth. Not always as we would like to see it, but brought to life with poignancy and depth.\nThe writing is sharp and beautiful, the characters hard to forget and the story well developed.\nA psychological profile, a story of king, his family and ancient Israel, this has something for historians and fans of modern literature. Artful, courageous and powerful.\n\n#newrelease \nGet \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 THE DAVID CHRONICLES \n\u2665  The David Chronicles: Boxed Set The David Chronicles\u00a0is the story of David as you have never heard it before: from the king himself, telling the unofficial version, the one he never allowed his court scribes to recount.

Join the facebook event to find out more! Travel costs are reimbursed. Please share with your friends & family members who are 16 to 18. Thank you! Mood in Young People - Brain Imaging Study! Information regarding recruitment of volunteers for study ref PNM/12/13-44, approved by Psychiatry, Nursing & Midwifery Research Ethics Subcommittee. This project contributes to King\u2019s College London's role in conducting research, and teaching research methods. You are under no obligation to reply to this post, however if you choose to, participation in this research is voluntary and you may withdraw at any time.\n\nYOU ARE BEING INVITED TO TAKE PART IN A NEW AND EXCITING PROJECT!\nWe are looking for healthy right handed adolescents aged **16 to 18 years old** to take part in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. We want to know more about which parts of the brain are involved when young people feel either sad or happy. We hope that by learning about these parts of the brain we will better understand what could make young people depressed.\n\nWHAT WILL I BE ASKED TO DO?\nWe will ask you to participate in an MRI brain scan. The brain scan is considered very safe, painless and non-invasive and has been used with millions of people around the world without hurting them or changing anything about them. The scan takes a picture of your brain, either while you do nothing or while your brain is active and you are watching a film clip in the scanner. You will watch two different film clips: one happy and one sad. We will ask you to tell us how you feel before and after watching each film. This will tell us about the activity of your brain. You will be in the scanner for about **1 hour**. We will also ask you and your parent/carer to complete some short questionnaires.\n\nDO I HAVE TO TAKE PART?\nNo. It is entirely up to you whether you take part or not. If you do want to take part you will be asked to sign a form to say that you would like to take part. Once you have signed this form, you can still change your mind at any time and you do not have to say why. \n\nWILL I GET ANYTHING FOR TAKING PART?\n-    To thank you for your time we will give you ** \u00a350 ** for the MRI scan. \n-    We will also give you, your mum, dad or carer any bus, taxi or train ** fare ** back or some petrol money if you came by car, so that you have no costs. \n-    We will also give you a ** picture of your brain ** either by email or on photographic paper.\n\nI WANT TO TAKE PART IN THE PROJECT \u2013 WHAT SHOULD I DO?\nIf you are interested in taking part in the study, you can write to Nina Mikita at the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, PO85, Institute of Psychiatry, King\u2019s College London, De Crespigny Park, London SE5 8AF for more information. You can also email nina.mikita@kcl.ac.uk , call 0207 848 0466 or contact Nina on facebook.",
