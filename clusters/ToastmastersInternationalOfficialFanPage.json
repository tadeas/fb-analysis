          "Portrait of a Toastmaster:\nKeith Hayden, CL\nHickam Toastmasters Club, Honolulu, Hawaii\n\nA Look into Leadership\n\nFor officers in the United States Air Force, leadership is an everyday endeavor. Whether in the office or in a deployed environment in charge of a large unit (or just in charge of ourselves), we need leadership. Toastmasters has provided me with a professional and permissive environment, not only to hone my own leadership skills, but more importantly to help young Airmen develop theirs.\n\nWhen I attend Toastmasters functions with other clubs in our district, I notice that most club members I meet are older professionals who want to improve their speaking and leadership skills. But my club is unique in two fundamental ways: 1) most of our members are under 30 and generally have little experience with public speaking, and 2) most of them are affiliated with the military, or are serving in the military, which means our membership is transitory. These two factors influence our club greatly, and as a result most meetings are focused on keeping a younger audience engaged while helping them develop as leaders and communicators.\n\nI joined Toastmasters in June 2015, and because I believe strongly in the Toastmasters mission, I signed up for a leadership position during the second meeting I attended. Our club has been Distinguished for 10 years, thanks to very dedicated members who have since moved on in their careers. Our club\u2019s success now rests on my shoulders and on those of my fellow officers.\n\n#PortraitofaToastmaster #Toastmasters #leadership United States Air Force #USAF#HickamToastmastersClub #KeithHayden #Honolulu #Hawaii.

          "Portrait of a Toastmaster, Valsakumar P. Menon, DTM\nDubai Toastmasters Club, Dubai, United Arab Emirates\n\nI Achieved My Secret Dream\n\nIn 2002, I was 35 years old and doing well professionally as a senior manager with a reputed organization in Dubai. But I faced a big challenge: I could not muster the courage to speak to a group of people. When it came to one-on-one conversations or speaking to a group of friends, I had no issue. But put me in front of three people I didn\u2019t know and I would become tongue-tied, forgetting everything I had prepared. \nBut I was in awe of people who could do that. So I nurtured this secret dream to\nbe a speaker and trainer\u2014a dream I thought would never come true. \nIn those days, a gentleman would occasionally come to our organization and deliver coaching and education sessions. One day I mustered the courage to ask him, \u201cSir, how can I improve my speaking skills?\u201d In response he simply said, \u201cJoin Toastmasters.\u201d That\u2019s when the magic of Toastmasters began in my life.\nI have been a member of the Dubai Toastmasters club for the last 14 years, and my life has completely changed. Going from someone who couldn\u2019t utter two words in front of an audience to someone who speaks for a living, I have realized my dream of being a speaker, trainer and entrepreneur.\nMy journey was not easy at first. But the encouragement, support and motivation I drew from club members helped me come to terms with my fear. I could never thank Ralph C. Smedley enough for creating Toastmasters. I do my bit to promote Toastmasters within the community so that more people can benefit from its magic. We also bring the program to children through our Gavel clubs and Youth Leadership programs. \nToastmasters has given me so much. I am better-equipped to cope with life\u2019s ups and downs. In short, the program has helped to bring out a better version of me and I am eternally grateful.\n \n#Toastmasters #DubaiToastmastersClub #publicspeaking #Wednesdaywisdom #leadership #career #speech #Youthleadershipprograms #RalphcSmedley #Dubai #PortraitofaToastmaster.

          "Portrait of a Toastmaster, Michael Sloan, CC, CL\nTalking Point at Docklands, Victoria, Australia \n\nHow Toastmasters Made Me a Great Dad\n\nFrom sleepless nights to constant diaper changes, caring for babies comes with a host of new challenges, but unlike Toastmasters, there are no manuals to follow. I have benefited from Toastmasters in my professional development, but as an unexpected bonus, it also made me a great dad! \nWhen I\u2019m with my baby daughter Zoe, all of my Toastmasters skills are on full display. My Table Topics training comes out when she points at a random object and expects an on-the-spot explanation of what it is. My vocal variety oscillates between highs and lows as I bring characters like Miss Piggy and Hippo to life before my daughter\u2019s eyes. And anything within her grasp becomes a visual aid with which I can teach, entertain or distract her. There is never a dull moment and I get the same joy and adrenaline rush in the day-to-day moments with my daughter as I get from an invigorating Toastmasters meeting. The only difference is that my energy needs to last much longer when I\u2019m with Zoe.  \nMy daughter has also taught me how to be a better Toastmaster. My speaking has improved as I incorporate more emotion into my talks and I am better attuned to listening and observing things because of her. I\u2019ve collected amusing anecdotes, pondered life changing decisions and made lifestyle adjustments\u2014all great material for new speeches.\nIn parenting there are no ribbons, awards or rounds of applause when you complete a task, but it is such a rewarding experience, full of laughs and tender moments. So thank you Toastmasters for teaching me not only speaking and leadership skills, but for also providing me with a loose parenting manual. And thank you Zoe for teaching me what life is all about.  \n\n#Toastmasters #portraitofatoastmaster @talkingpointtm #parenting #publicspeaking #career #speech #leadership.

          "Portrait of a Toastmaster, A St. Patrick\u2019s Day Proposal\n\nPeter Junker, ACB, Atlas \u2018Olelo Hui, Honolulu, Hawaii\n\nIt was a memorable St. Patrick's Day last year for those who attended the Atlas \u2018Olelo Hui Toastmasters meeting. I delivered my first speech from the Professional Speaker manual. It was entitled \u201cYou're Never Too Old.\u201d \n\nI listed all the things that I was not too old to start. I shared how I became a stand-up comedian at age 52, a photographer at 55, and a Toastmaster's competitor and second place district winner at 62.  \n\nI went on to describe how I fell in love at the age of 64, and showed photos of my sweetheart, Monica, that I thought showed off her personality. I had invited Monica to attend the meeting that day, so after sharing the pictures I asked her up to the lectern to formally introduce her to my Toastmasters friends and vice versa. After the introductions, I calmly asked Monica to marry me. After a nervous giggle, she said \"Yes!\"  \n\nI then remarked that \u201cthe greatest lesson I have learned is that you're never too old to get married as I will be 66 when we exchange vows.\u201d\n\nLater Monica evaluated my speech and used the sandwich method.  She said I did a great job of capturing the audience's interest, the speech was well organized and the content was enjoyable. One area she thought could have been better was if I told her I loved her, but overall, she thoroughly enjoyed the speech and was glad she got to hear it in person and be a part of it. I now plan on incorporating what I learned from her evaluation as I work on our wedding vows.\n\n#Toastmasters #PortraitofaToastmaster #stpatricksday2017 #ToastmastersDistrict49 #Proposal #PublicSpeaking #AtlasOleloHuiToastmasters.

Bluman, ACG\nMcKeesport Area club, White Oak, Pennsylvania \n\nA Lecture and a Speech \n\nAs a mathematics teacher of 39 years at the high school, college and graduate school levels, I know how to give a lecture. But when I joined Toastmasters in 1972, the first thing I learned was there is a difference between giving a lecture and a speech.  \n\nOne of the most important things Toastmasters taught me was how to deliver an acceptance speech. In 2010 I was inducted into the McKeesport High School Alumni Hall of Fame and was required to give a short speech at the award ceremony. Fortunately for me, the Special Occasion Speeches manual has a five-to-seven minute speech entitled \u201cAccepting an Award.\u201d\n\nThe manual stated there are three main ingredients for this type of speech: gratitude, recognition and sincerity. For the gratitude part, I acknowledged my wife and my father, who both played a major role in my achievements. For the recognition part, I thanked the Alumni Hall of Fame committee for recognizing my achievements. For the sincerity part, I expressed my appreciation for the reward. \n\nThe manual also included some information on minding my manners and receiving the award. All this in five to seven minutes! I was able to practice my speech in front of the McKeesport Area club, and I received evaluation tips on what to improve. One of my fellow Toastmasters even gave me some tips on how to refrain from crying during the speech.\n\nNeedless to say, when the time came for me to give my speech in front of 250 people, all went well. Thank you, Toastmasters International! \n\n#Toastmasters #PortraitofaToastmaster #Speech #Mathematics #Education #McKeesportAreaClub #Pennsylvania #HallofFame http://bit.ly/2le7puT.

I allowed myself to be teased in school, and never asked questions in class or in life. Even when I started actively volunteering in my community, I couldn\u2019t fully express why I cared so much about these causes or convince others to care. Things changed when I joined  Toastmasters in August 2013. My confidence grew, my stage presence became more powerful, and my storytelling skills were sharpened.  \nThe rewards of this transformation became clear when I got involved with an organization called Freedom House, which runs shelters for human trafficking survivors in the Bay Area. In April 2016, I was asked to teach a class on human trafficking at the UC Berkeley.\nI accepted the challenge. Three years prior, I would have been consumed by my insecurities as a speaker and unable to make an impact. These students were there to learn, and I had important facts and stories to share with them. I could feel their growing passion with every question asked and every life experience shared. At the end of class, the organizers told me I was the most engaging presenter of that lecture series. \nBy improving communication and leadership skills, Toastmasters helps people deepen relationships, enhance presentations, and become an overall better version of themselves. Because of Toastmasters, I can speak up for myself and the causes I care about. This is why I choose to give back as the club growth director of District 4, where I\u2019m tasked to build new clubs and strengthen existing ones. I\u2019m passionate about creating an environment so more Toastmasters can learn how to be more effective in the areas of their lives that matter to them the most.\n\nToastmasters International  Rhino Business Toastmasters  #Toastmasters #SanFrancisco #PortraitofaToastmaster.

          "Portrait of a #Toastmaster: Joanne Fox, CC\nToastmasters\u2019 Canton Public Speaking club, Canton, Ohio \n\nToastmasters has been a vital part of my life for 64 years, although I didn\u2019t initially recognize it as such.  \nI was only 2 years old when my father, William Hewett, joined what was formerly known as the American Legion Toastmasters club in Canton, Ohio, in 1952. That was the beginning of his 60-year tenure as a Toastmaster, and the start of my childhood memories as well. I remember the club\u2019s Christmas parties with Santa, and summer picnics with ball games. I remember my father rehearsing his speeches in our living room, as I often wondered, What\u2019s that all about? \nMy father became a fine speaker over the next few decades and enjoyed the research necessary to give his various speeches. Then in 1974, a young man by the name of Dennis Fox joined my father at his club. One year I was asked to provide piano carol music for a Christmas party hosted by the club, and since my parents were in Florida that year, they asked Dennis to escort me to and from the party. We began dating and got married a year and a half later. \nAlthough the American Legion Toastmasters club was exclusively for men at the time, guests and wives were invited to attend the speech contests. While giving moral support to Dennis, I began to see how speeches were given in front of an audience. However, I didn\u2019t discover the full scope of Toastmasters until I joined in 2012\u2014by that time, the club (now called Toastmasters\u2019 Canton Public Speaking club) had changed its all-male policy.  \nI joined because I am passionate about our food system and have grave concerns about how the animals we eat are treated and how crops are grown. I wanted to have a reason to dig deeper and give voice to my beliefs and concerns. However, I have gained much more than I anticipated. I have not only learned how to prepare a speech and deliver it well, but also how to listen and evaluate others. \nToastmasters is a significant part of my life. With my father\u2019s 60 years as a member, my husband\u2019s 42 years and my own four-year involvement, Toastmasters has always been a family affair.\n \nToastmasters International #PortraitofaToastmaster #PublicSpeaking #Speech #FamilyAffair #Love #Education Canton Public Speaking Club - Toastmasters Club 637.

I met members who received it in five years and those who took over 10 years to earn it. At 53 years of age, I didn't want to take that long to earn this prestigious honor.  After some research online, I found that the shortest amount of time on record was two years and one day, and developed a plan to earn my own DTM in two years (strategically knocking off the one day).\n \nI \u201cstudied\u201d Toastmasters as if it was a Masters level course. I joined a total of five clubs, held several offices at the club and district level, and solicited the help of several DTMs and past district governors to teach me all that I needed to know to became a Toastmaster Guru!  I was strategic with every speech, every project, and nothing I did in the name of Toastmasters went undocumented. \n\nI was awarded my DTM at the 2015 District 58 Fall Conference, and held a breakout session entitled, \"Work Smarter, Not Harder - Road to DTM in Two Years\". I shared my strategy with the group and it was well received by all. I've had several of the session attendees approach me over the last several months to thank me for the tips and tools from the session.\n\nBeing a DTM is such a wonderful honor. It takes a lot of work, but it is an indication of the improvements I've made in my leadership and communication skills. I've helped other people grow and develop as well.  I think every Toastmaster can use some tips on how to strategically work Toastmasters into their daily routine and receive a DTM in their shortest amount of time.\n\n#Toastmasters #PortraitofaToastmaster #EarlenaBrown #MondayMotivation #TubeMasters.

Up until that point I had resisted going because of my busy school schedule, which kept me occupied four evenings out of the week. \n\nI was invited to E.T. Communicators Toastmasters Club, which met every Friday evening. This meant becoming a Toastmaster would have me involved in an activity every evening of the week.

Each project moved me up the communication ladder one at a time. I soon became a more confident and willing participant in my weekly Bible study group discussions. \n\nBy the time I completed my eighth project in the CC manual, it was time for office elections for the 2014-2015 term.

Additionally, I was able to practice at the elementary school where I served with supportive feedback from the staff.\n \nAt the area and division levels, the competition was stiff, but the contests were enjoyable. To my surprise, my fellow district level competitors were encouraging. Though I'd not met most of them prior to that event, they helped me have a positive experience.

They laughed and sighed just as if I had cued them in. \n\nThough I did not progress past the district level, I gained another level of confidence and humility. The experience gave me the desire to continue working in my community. The feedback from viewers let me know the topic touched many members. After the competition, some shared of a parent who stepped from the shadows of illiteracy or that of a young person they knew who struggled at one time.

And I am currently working on my second.\n\nI was 56 when I joined Toastmasters so I felt that I needed to master public speaking quickly to help my chances of job advancement. I now know how to prepare speeches and deliver them well. I gained confidence that I never had before. Toastmasters has made a large improvement in my professional and personal life.\n\n#Toastmasters #PortraitofaToastmasters #publicspeaking #leadership #ToastmastersDistrict62 #Workplace.

          "Portrait of a Toastmaster: Sojan Paul, ACB, ALB\nAlturki Toastmasters Club\nAl Kohbar, Saudi Arabia\n\nWhy Did I Join Toastmasters?\n\nWhy join Toastmasters? \nI\u2019ve been asked this question repeatedly since I joined my club. The answer is simple; I wanted to be a better communicator. All living beings are communicators, either directly or indirectly. A blossoming flower has something to communicate to its pollinators. An ant has even more to communicate with its coworkers and competitors. If we listen, the message is clear. But we often do not listen. \nWhen I attended my first club meeting, the Table Topicsmaster called me onstage. That was, in fact, the first time I faced an audience. I went to the stage, looked at the audience and felt them staring at me as if I were a rare animal. To make a long story short, I couldn\u2019t utter a single word that day. \nAfter that, I asked myself, why should I go again? The answer came immediately. The worst had already happened, and there was no need to be afraid any longer. If I could utter a single word this time, it would be a great achievement. I did attend the second meeting, and I haven\u2019t stopped attending since. The more meetings I attend, the less afraid I am on stage.\nSo far I have won 14 trophies in club- and area-level speech contests. I also participated in a division-level contest and won in all five categories, including Table Topics! I could do this only because of #Toastmasters. My goal is to become the World Champion of Public Speaking\u00ae .\n\nToastmasters International\n#PortraitofaToastmaster #PublicSpeaking #Communication #WhereLeadersAreMade #AlturkiToastmastersClub #SaudiArabia.

Last year, I was fortunate to serve as club president and learned a lot, especially about listening. I went from not reading to liking to read and write. I regularly read the Toastmaster magazine from which I learn vocabulary while being inspired by excellent ideas.

I was in a deep depression and I could not accept reality. \n\nA dear friend told me, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come to a Toastmasters meeting? It might help you move on.\u201d \n\nIn April 2009 I attended a meeting. I already knew something about it, since my friend had talked about it several times before. I joined the Ixtaccihuatl club. In May of that year I was elected vice president education, but my problems continued. I studied and studied, but I did not understand anything. \n\nBut thanks to my mentors, I moved forward, giving 10 speeches and earning a Competent Communicator award. After I was elected club president, I discovered abilities I had kept stored in the memory of days past\u2014memories of my childhood and what I had inherited from my parents. From my father I learned to be a leader and to have a clear, objective goal. From my mother I learned responsibility, dignity, integrity and reciting. \n\nI went on to win Humorous Speech contests in 2009 and 2010, and in March 2013, I won first place in a women\u2019s speech contest at an International Women\u2019s Day event.\n\nI found the most success in leadership and in educational advances in 2014 and 2015. I served as area governor and I was the club mentor for the Redjal club and a coach for the Aztlan club, both in Guadalajara. I also conducted a High Performance Leadership project, founding the Amor por Mexico Gavel club.\n\nI am a different woman today. My self-confidence has improved and I feel valued by my Toastmasters partners, friends and family.

          "Portrait of a Toastmaster:\nJohn Kelly, ACB, ALB\nSunbelt Speakers club\nMarlborough, New Zealand \n\nMy Marathons\n\nIn June 2013 I set a challenge for myself: I would run a marathon every month for 12 months. I didn\u2019t know if I was fit enough or whether I could recover quickly enough between each race. But I did know that I wanted to do something that challenged me mentally, physically and emotionally.\n\nI started the challenge in July 2013 with a 46-kilometer (approximately 28 miles) run in the hills of Christchurch, New Zealand. In August I visited an Alpine Village where I ran from the village up and over a mountain pass, to a ski field, then back again. I climbed more than 1,700 meters (approximately 5,600 feet) that day and took more than seven hours to finish.\n\nThings were looking good. I felt strong, my fitness was improving and I was starting to get some momentum.\n\nThen, in September of that year, I had a major setback. I was struck with a bad case of gastroenteritis. I was unable to eat for several days and rapidly lost strength and fitness. However, I was determined that this would not defeat me. I used the idea of every hardship being a twist in a great speech for each of the subsequent marathons to help me mentally battle through the hard times. This mindset was especially important when I ran 86 kilometers (approximately 53 miles) in one day to check off the last two marathons of the challenge. It also provided me with an abundance of speech material and helped rekindle my passion for Toastmasters. \n\nFor more information about my 12 months of marathons challenge, check out www.facebook.com/12marathons\n\n#Toastmaster #Marathon #Challenge #Leadership #NewZealand #PortraitofaToastmasters #fitness.

Those three words formed a question posed by an ill-informed, ignorant stranger. Ana, to whom the question was directed, delicately described that experience in response to a Table Topics question she answered during a meeting of the Bethesda Community Toastmasters. She explained how the question infuriated her, and how her mother, who was also present, was shocked.\n\nAna was born with Down syndrome, and while she may struggle with developmental delays and disabilities, no one in our club would ask that question. Not only can she talk, she can deliver speeches, make us laugh and command the attention of a large audience. And, she can serve as sergeant at arms for our club.\n\nDelightful, engaging and bold are the words that come to mind when describing Ana. In one of her speeches (my favorite), she described the different dances she has learned throughout the years. She delivered it complete with ballet slippers, music and a full-on demonstration. She also asked us to get up and dance, and of course we did.\n\nIn addition to giving speeches, she enjoys introducing the word of the day. She works hard to ensure that the word is just tough enough that we need to think about it, while familiar enough that a couple of us can work it into our own speeches.\nIn October 2014, Ana, a long-term volunteer at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C., was hired by the Smithsonian Libraries, where she labels books, handles circulation and helps with the mail. She credits her club engagement and devoted parents with making this dream a reality.\n\nAna\u2019s parents\u2014the long-standing Toastmasters Ginny Colten-Bradley, CTM, and Michael Bradley, ACS\u2014are the delightful staples of our club. In March 2015, our club was recognized by an organization that serves individuals affected by intellectual and developmental disabilities for our ongoing support of Ana. The truth is, it\u2019s a two-way street. Ana supports us just as much as we support her.\nNot only is Ana a great speaker\u2014she has us expecting great things of her. We eagerly await her next achievement.\n\nContributed by Jennifer Collins, ACB, ALB, of Bethesda Community Toastmasters.\n\n#Toastmasters Toastmasters International Bethesda Community Toastmasters\n#PortraitofaToastmaster  #PublicSpeaking #Communication #Leadership #WhereLeadersAreMade #Smithsonian.

I even had the attention of teachers in the audience.\n\nAlthough I was not trained as a vocational/special education teacher, in Toastmasters I developed the skills I needed to fill in as a substitute in the classroom.

That 91 year old is Walt McHugh, ATMB, CL, a 35-year member and this year's President's Cup Winner of our club in California.\n\nIn his early years, Walt enlisted in the Army Air Corps to become a radar technician between the ages of 18-21, and served from 1943-46. During World War II, Walt was a radar operator/mechanic on-board a Merchant Marine manned transport ship bringing back European and Asian theater combat troops.  After the war, Walt went to college to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering from Mississippi State University.\n\nUpon graduation, he moved to California to work in the Aerospace industry.  At the onset, he worked as a stress analyst at North American Aviation, but developed a fond interest in marketing. He developed proposals for the famous Hughes Aircraft to various military development commands, including coordinating presentations to the Chief of Naval Operations at the Pentagon.\n\nIn his later years, Walt had a career in teaching, and once retired, he spent summers as an independent contractor writing several proposals and specifications for projects.\n  \nDuring his long and illustrious Toastmasters journey, he has participated in and won several speaking contests, \"gathering a few trophies along the way\" as he humbly puts it. We are very proud to have Walt as a member and mentor in our club and, he says, \"At age 91, I'm still enjoying the Toastmasters experience.\"              \n\nContributed by Noland Flores, CC, CL\n\n#Toastmasters #PortraitofaToastmasters  #publicspeaking #leadership  #DistrictOneToastmasters #SanPedroToastmasters #ArmyAirCorps #WorldWarII.

A case of mild postpartum depression took over. As I saw it, everything he said and did was wrong during the first several months after our baby was born.

One Wednesday evening, as he was getting ready to attend his meeting, I informed Pesa that I would file for divorce the next morning. After a lot of yelling on my part, and a lot of listening and apologizing on his, he suggested that we both go to the meeting.\nFor the first time, I met my husband\u2019s fellow club members and learned how their meetings were structured. They invited me to participate in Table Topics, and I managed to come out of my shell and speak for a whopping 19 seconds.\nFrom that week on, we made every Wednesday our official date night. #Toastmasters came first, followed by dinner and then coffee at a local bookstore. Pesa is now president of the club and I currently serve as vice president membership. Serving as officers together has helped us appreciate the value of teamwork in our marriage as well.

I had a hard time at work and was very sensitive to anything my boss said to me. I hated going anywhere new and meeting new people.\n\nI was always hiding a piece of me that I was embarrassed of, even though that piece was not always easy to hide. I am visually impaired. This made it awkward to meet new people because I couldn\u2019t pick up on social cues from their facial expressions. Shortly after joining the Indian Head Toastmasters club in 2013, I did a speech on my disability. It felt so good to have somewhere to go where I could be myself and not have to hide. I set a goal to do a speech every week and make it through all 10 projects of the Competent Communication manual.\n\nDuring my journey, my vision started to deteriorate even more. Within a few months I quickly went from having fuzzy vision to not being able to see anything except for bright light. This was very hard to deal with, but with the help of Toastmasters I kept giving speeches as a way to help me cope. It made a world of difference to have that safe place to tell my story and have the support of others who never judged me.\n\nThe members of the Indian Head club continue to be there for me. When I got my first guide dog in 2014, they were some of my biggest cheerleaders. They gave me the confidence to be my own advocate. I have made a few public speaking appearances, talking about blindness and guide dogs, and have started a support group for seniors new to vision loss.\n\nTwo years ago I would have struggled to tell you my name was Ashley Nemeth.

Toastmasters provided me a practice field where I\u2019ve gained the skills and the confidence to make the jump into the corporate world of leadership. \nDuring my delivery of the conference speech, I moved comfortably onstage, and used vocal variety and appropriate body language. As I continued, I remembered the importance of maintaining eye contact, so I left the stage to get closer to my audience.\nJust like a fish jumping out of a small bowl of water, I would never have jumped had it not been for Toastmasters. I had to build my confidence to make that jump. You might say that members of my club were coaches from whom I\u2019ve learned the art of speaking.  \n\n#PortraitOfAToastmaster #Toastmasters Toastmasters - Paul Revere Club.

          "My first project: Ice Breaker    Name: David Liang\n\nTitle: My Cultural Marathon\n\ntime: 6:30 minutes\n\n1 year ago God started talking to me that I should build a new tunnel to connect the East and the West. I founded the student organization Belhaven University Far East movement and I am currently the president. We have been conducting cultural events on campus and we have been building relationships with local charity organizations and worldwide Christian ministries in order to serve our communities as well as collaborate to develop art and cultural projects that could help foster cultural understanding between the American and Chinese peoples. However ambitious this vision may sound, it started in China 13 years ago on one afternoon when I decided that I wanted to become a good English speaker and travel around the world. \n\nI shared my idea with my friends and they all laughed at me, even my parents. In reality, there was no way I could make it. I came from the typical lower class Chinese family and my parents obeyed the single child policy so well that I never got to learn what sibling competition is. My parents did not have much education and they spent their entire lives working at local factories. We lived in a slum area and I grew up without fancy clothes, no pets and all my toys were self-invented. I borrowed textbooks from my cousins when I attended elementary school and my parents\u2019 savings never went beyond the 4th digit. \n\nSo, to speak good English and travel around the world, people would say \u201cno way.\u201d \nBut I looked at myself into the mirror and I thought that even though I had nothing, I at least had faith. So, I started my ambitious language Marathon and began to practice my English every day.\n\nI purchased a book from LiYang Crazy English,  one of the biggest English education services in China, and practiced pronunciation day and night.\nI memorized Disney movies and tried to act out the stories. During the week days, I shouted English in the public, such as in buses crowded with people, at restaurants, and shopping malls. Occasionally, I also dreamed in English and I would practice singing nursery songs. Such as \u201cIf you are happy and you know it clap your hands\u201d\n\nIn 2004, I became a Christian and I met an old American missionary at my church. He literally changed my life. His name is Jim Marshall but I call him my daddy in faith now. He baptized me in a public swimming pool and spiritually adopted me as his son in faith. In 2005, with Jim\u2019s help, I developed my ambition further. I wanted to rebuild my childhood in English. By doing that with me, Jim has been reliving his own in me.  It was a moment like when Paul found his Timothy. He began to home school me over the Internet and he spent every possible minute to teach me and read with me.\n\nDuring the entire 5 years after Jim left China and before I came to America, our being together over the internet could be imagined as if we were shopping in an American cultural mall. You could imagine that we would visit the Literary Bar at night, where we would open a bottle of \u201cMark Twin\u2019s Classics\u201d and devour the \u201cHuckle Berry Finn Cake\u201d, then we explored how \u201cDo little\u201d became \u201cDo Nobel\u201d and then we would enter into the \u201cCS Lewis\u2019 Wardrobe\u201d and found our way into \u201cAlex\u2019s wonderland.\u201d \n\nNot surprisingly, in the \u201cPhilosophy Kitchen\u201d, we would grind through Leo Tolstoy, Emanuel Kant, Nietzsche, etc. in our intellectual food processor and seasoned the puree with the Biblical pepper. \n\nIn the \u201cScience Fair\u201d, we would ride our bikes along the winding digestive tract; then we would get lost in the ear Labyrinth and end up playing the ear drums. We would swim inside the eyeballs to look for the blind spot, where we could get showered and changed.\n\nIn the \u201cCultural Zone\u201d, we would bake our \u201cAmerica Pies\u201d and enjoy suffering the \u201cGrowing pains\u201d, we danced through the \u201cHigh School Musicals\u201d and explored the secret of dating. \n\nIn 2006, I began teaching English in several institutions, including Crazy English and English First International. In 2008, with Jim\u2019s help, I signed up for the Belhaven Virtual Campus and began my online Christian education.\n\nIn 2009, I was awarded an art scholarship by Belhaven University and I came to the USA in the summer of that year. Since then, I have upgraded my Childhood project into an \u201cAdulthood Project\u201d and Jim and I are still working on it. \n\nToday I have become a better man and blessedly upgraded in every area of my life, it seems I am every second getting closer to the finishing line of my 13 year marathon.\n But God has told me He has a second marathon for me and this time is in the Pacific Ocean. I pray that He will give me the strength to pull through and wisdom to navigate. I pray that  He will provide me a vessel big enough to contain many young people, American and Chinese alike, to work together and build more tunnels between the 2 major cultures connected by that great ocean. \nI pray that this divine voyage will allow me to discover a new continent where people of all cultures can live in peace and harmony. \n\n\nAmen.\n\nPlease check out my club \n\nBU Far East Movement\n\nWe conduct cultural event to promote understanding between people and serve our local communities through cultures. My 13 year cultural Marathon.",
