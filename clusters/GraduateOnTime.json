          "Maklumbalas peserta bengkel Kesedaran Minda / Candidate feedback on Mental Awareness - 18.10.15 (Rinah - PhD candidate)\n\nI have graduated my Master Degree more than a decade ago, so I started my PhD on quite shaky ground. Plus, I had no experience writing up a thesis during my Master studies. I attended many other courses provided for postgraduate students everywhere just to get the grasp on PhD making but resulted in not satisfying outcome. I was still confused and trailed off every now and then.\nUntil I attended Mr. Dom's Kesedaran Minda / Mental Awareness workshop. Then only I know the correct steps of doing research. We were given very clear structure of PhD making, from one step to another.\nThe class is conducted in small groups so the impact is high. Mr. Dom constantly checked our understanding and extended extra help.\nThanks Mr. Dom! Timeline Photos.",

          "Mengimbas kenangan masa persekolahan dulu atas permintaan kawan sekelas Nooraini Mat Saat dan Siti Arpah Salleh. Saya adalah bekas pelari. Acara padang dan juga merentas desa - jaraknya mungkin dalam 5 - 6 km merentasi desa. Cross country. Dalam acara ini pemeriksa akan ditempatkan di lokasi2 strategik untuk memastikan pelari2 melalui setiap lokasi strategik sebagai tanda penyempurnaan keseluruhan jarak tadi. Sekiranya pelari tidak melalui sebarang lokasi strategik, ini akan membatalkan lariannya kerana ini menunjukan pelari tidak melalui keseluruhan jarak tadi. Short cut mungkin! Dalam pada itu banyak papan tanda arah akan ditempatkan disepanjang jarak pelarian untuk menunjukkan arah larian itu samada ke kiri, kanan, terus atau pusing balik. Pada penghujungnya ramai juga yang tidak menamatkan keseluruhan jarak tersebut utk berbagai sebab. Berhenti.\n\nKembali kepada penulisan tesis. \nPelari adalah calon Master / PhD. Menamatkan larian adalah Graduate on Time. Pemeriksa check point adalah Kerapian Akademik. Papan tanda arah adalah matlamat dan objecktif kajian. Jurulatih adalah Supervisor. Pelari yang tak tamatkan larian adalah calon yang tak complete pengajian.  Ramai yang berhenti pengajian atas berbagai sebab.\n\nMerujuk kepada AsterWrite\nAsterWrite menentukan arah larian, jarak larian, kerapian akademik yang wajib dilalui setiap calon untuk mencapai matlamat dan objektif kajian. Ini samalah seperti menentukan arah tuju yang betul supaya selamat sampai ke destinasi dengan tepat. AsterWrite juga memainkan peranan Supervisor dalam membimbing cara2 terbaik persediaan menghadapi cabaran penulisan tesis yang penuh dgn kerapian akademik melalui pendekatan langkah demi langkah. Akhirkata AsterWrite adalah GPS di tangan calon untuk Graduate on Time. \n\nKalau itu baru merentas desa, (Master / PhD) adalah MARATHON! Jaraknya adalah 42.5 km. Jadi memanglah CABARAN ini jauh lebih banyak lagi dari merentas desa. Di situlah AsterWrite memainkan peranan penting dalam membimbing Calon untuk menamatkan pengajian dengan sebaik-baiknya dalam masa yang di tentukan pada waktu pendaftaran. Graduate on Time!\n\nJoin AsterWrite dan ikuti perkembangannya.",

          "Action Research - 1. Identify\n\nAsterWrite is an subscription based online software that has many tools for each of the various steps in Action Research. Tools are customized for different functions and can be assembled together to complete an Action Research. The different tools, their description, indication of the purpose and a simple output is shown below. Although some tools may appear too simple, the inclusion of these tools add high credibility to the Action Research.\n\nProcess Flow\nA Process Flow Chart is used to describe the sequence and relationship of the tasks that make up an activity. A chart representing a process flow may be called a Process Flow Chart. A process flow chart records graphically or diagrammatically, in sequence, the operations connected with a process. The Process Flow Chart portrays the process with the help of a set of symbols and aids in better understanding and examining the process.\n\nCheck List\nCheck List is a simple yet powerful task management tool that helps to plan projects, prioritize \"To Do\" items, note responsibilities and record accomplishments.\n\nCause-Effect Diagram\nCause-Effect Diagram is visualization and knowledge organization tool. The Cause-Effect Diagram is a tool that provides a systematic way of looking at all the causes that influence an effect. The diagram is based on simply collecting and arranging the ideas of a group in a systematic way that facilitates the understanding and ultimate diagnosis of the problem.\n\nPareto Analysis\nPareto Analysis is a statistical technique in decision-making used for the selection of a few tasks that produce significant overall effect. It uses the Pareto Principle or the 80/20 rule - the idea that by doing 20% of the work you can generate 80% of the benefits.\n\nHistogram\nHistogram is a graphical display of tabulated frequencies which shows what proportion of cases fall into each of several specified non-overlapping, adjacent categories (intervals) of some variable.\n\nScatter Plot\nScatter Plot (or Scatter Graph) is a graph used to display and compare two or more sets of related quantitative data each having a coordinate (x, y). A Scatter Plot is used to investigate the possible relationship between two variables. A straight line of best fit (using the least squares method) is often included.\n\nProject Plan\nThe Project Plan is a template for project definition justifying why a project is needed. It comprises of the Project Plan and Project Charter. The Project Plan records and formalizes the Objectives, Benefits, Project Team, Schedule and Scope. The Project Charter spells the Product or Service Impacted, Expected Project Savings and several other project specific details.\n\nVital X\nThe Vital X is a simple but important tool to formalize the selection of vital variables in an array of variables. A direct frequency count is used to establish the importance of factors. The factor with the highest rating is considered most important.\n\nWeighted Score\nThe Weighted Score tool is used to weight impacts related to an array of variables. A list of variables are given a direct rating under a classified group. The classified group itself has a weighting. The product of the direct rating and the weighting is then used to arrive at a weighted rating. Timeline Photos.",

          "Advancing Action Research \n\nAction Research is a very important means of research that is conducted very extensively in many domains including: educational, healthcare, social science, community, and other settings.\n\nUsually many researchers struggle with the conventional method without a sense of direction mostly without much guidance. We propose the use of software (AsterWrite) to conduct the activities within the 6 steps identified in Action Research.\n\nConventional\n\nThe conventional way of conducting Action Research is limiting and restrictive. Not many researchers can \"quickly\" conduct say for example, a Likert scale analysis. Many studies are too simplistic, e.g. based on post-treatment test alone, or limited to basic percentage analysis. This is partly due to the need for the researcher to learn many time consuming complex software. This is a daunting task if one has to learn several different software for different purposes. This is an immense discouragement to say for example, a teacher trying to improve her teaching methods to a group of kindergarten children.\n\nSoftware\n\nIt is here that AsterWrite can help greatly. AsterWrite provides easy access to a large range of tools and techniques relevant to Action Research. AsterWrite is an online subscription based software that has many automated tools for research. AsterWrite is based on a templatized method of conducting research. For example, a researcher can conduct Likert scale analysis, Affinity analysis or Mind Map analysis using templates with analyses and output charts. This greatly enables the researcher to conduct original and deeper research easier, faster and better. The researcher can use a wide variety of tools and techniques for all the various steps as shown on the slide attached together with this article. The selection and usage of tools and techniques are limited only by the imagination and creativity of the researcher (YOU)! These are further elaborated in the subsequent postings and articles to be followed in the next few days. Timeline Photos.",

          "The Basic Steps of conducting Action Research\n\nCondensed in 6 steps as below:\n\nStep 1: Identify\n\nThis is the starting point. Review the situation and identify a problem that concerns you.\n\u2022What do I want to improve\n\u2022Why?\n\u2022How is it linked to my mission and goal\n\u2022What is the current way this process is carried out\n\u2022What are the key measures\n\u2022What data can be collected\n\nExample\n\nYou are a teacher and you have identified a problem in your classroom. The problem is that your students do not have much experience working in task groups, and you believe that they need to have more opportunities to do so. You want to assess the skill set of your students and observe their overall approach to group work. By doing this, you feel that next time you offer group work, you will have some new insight into what works well and what needs improvement regarding conducting group work in your class.\n\nStep 2: Plan\n\nDevise a Plan that will potentially solve your problem. The proposed solution may be a new instructional technique or strategy that you feel can potentially correct the problem. Define your experimental design (e.g. Post-treatment, Before-After, or Before-After--Control-Treatment) and how you will apply the technique and the method you will use to collect your data. Also consider how you will analyse the data.\n\nAssess Current State\n\u2022How big is the problem?\n\u2022Is there a \"Current State\" performance data?\n\nCause\n\u2022What are the root causes?\n\u2022Is there literature on how this can be improved?\n\nExample\n\nYour plan includes having your students work together in groups for their upcoming science project. By doing this, you hope to explore a variety of information, such as how the students brainstorm together, how they interact with each other and how they distribute work among the task groups. You provide them an instruction sheet and a time frame to work to.\n\nStep 3: Do\n\nConduct or implement your proposed solution. Enable the activities you in your Plan stage.\n\u2022Based on root cause, what can be done?\n\u2022What is my improvement idea\n\nExample \n\nYou act by assigning your students into groups and having them work through their group work. This step can also be thought of as initiating and carrying out the plan.\n\nStep 4: Study\n\nDuring the Study stage, you observe the effect of your Do stage. The observation may be behavioral, qualitative or quantitative data. The data may be recorded as audio-video, interview dialogues or measurements respectively. Each data type must be analysed appropriately. The outcome of this stage must determine how the proposed solution had an impact on the problem. This may be negative, zero or positive.\n\u2022Did my improvement work?\n\u2022Do I have \"New State\" performance data?\n\u2022How does this compare to \"Current State\" performance?\n\nExample\n\nThis is the observation and data collection phase. During this step, you observe the groups of students working together. You take note on how they are progressing and what issues they have. You watch them brainstorm and form interesting ideas. You observe any disruptive students who do not get along, argue or not participate altogether. This is a behavioral data. If you conducted an interview, you may collect qualitative data. If you conducted a countable or measurable inquiry, you may collect quantitative data. You must analyse the different types of data appropriately.\n\nStep 5: Act\n\nIf your study proved successful, you can implement your proposed solution to reflect a successful new technique. If your study proved partially successful or failed, you decide if you want to continue a second cycle by returning to the Plan stage to attempt a different proposed solution. Or, given the resources and timelines, you may wish to end the research.\n\u2022How can I incorporate new method?\n\u2022Make it into new regular method.\n\nStep 6: Reflect\n\nThis is the step where you reflect on the whole (each cycle and overall) research you conducted. What are the things gone right and the things gone wrong? On hindsight how could you have done better?\n\u2022Think it over\n\u2022On hindsight. Timeline Photos.",

Here is the follow-up....\n\nMost candidates (Master and PhD) spend most (if not their entire time) on writing, writing and more so on REWRITING their thesis.\nThesis Management suggests candidates are much better of in planning and developing an outline in agreement with their supervisor before starting to write. Once you have an agreeable outline you start writing in small sections; headings, sub-headings and sub-sub-headings. This way you keep building your thesis by adding a single brick developing it into a block at a time, every time. Towards the end of the day, your thesis emerges.\n\nSo for the need of planning and developing AN ACCEPTABLE OUTLINE of your thesis, writing is not as important at the early stage of your designing your research.\n\nRemember Pareto Principle? Yes the 80/20 Rule?\n80% of the population holds 20% of the wealth.\n20% of the population holds 80% of the wealth\n\nIn Thesis Management this translates to:\n80% time spent on planning results in 20% time in writing (smooth).\n20% time spent on planning results in 80% time in writing (struggle).\n\nSo PLAN ahead, Develop AN OUTLINE in agreement with your SV;\nand then start Writing for a smooth sailing.\n\nIf you need any help to design a research plan and to develop your OUTLINE, be in touch with us otherwise just Like and Share with your circle of friends.\n\n.
