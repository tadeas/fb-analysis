Initially, Facebook only allowed native link posts to be saved. \n\nWhat links can be saved (updated list): \n\n\u272f Native link posts (i.e. with preview intact)\n\u272f Status updates with links (link preview removed) \u25c6\n\u272f Photo posts with links (yay!) \u25c6\n\u272f Any post with multiple links (option comes up to Save All) \u25c6\n\u272f Any post with an @ tagged Page(s) (Page gets saved) \u25c6\n\u272f Pages\n\u272f Places\n\u272f Music\n\u272f Books\n\u272f Movies\n\u272f TV shows\n\u272f Events\n\n\u25c6 Indicates updated feature.\n\nNOTE: it's only the actual LINK that you are saving. You're not saving the whole post, status, photo, etc. But, Facebook does help you see where the original post came from with a 'via' link in your Saved area.\n\n[UPDATE: (added 9.24.14 at 12pm PT) -- you can also save links from posts directly on any Page's wall and on any personal profile wall, too!! With the latter, of course, privacy settings prevail. You can only see content shared publicly or to friends if you're friends with that person.]\n\nWhat still can\u2019t be saved:\n\n\u272f Status updates with no links\n\u272f Photo posts with no links\n\u272f Video posts (but you can save links to YouTube or Vimeo videos)\n\nI've updated this blog post to reflect the changes: http://www.marismith.com/5-things-businesses-need-to-know-about-facebooks-new-save-feature/\n\nKeep in mind that one of the latest news feed algorithm tweaks now gives priority in the news feed to native link posts (vs. link posts with the preview removed and photo posts with a link in the description, such as this post is!).

Using your Facebook native app, look for the Ads Manager bookmark.\n \nSEE: A New Way to Manage Facebook Ads on the Go via Facebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/business/news/manage-facebook-ads-on-the-go\n\n\u2461 EVENT ADS\n\nPreviously, event ads were only shown in the right-hand column on desktop. Now pages can create event ads for desktop and mobile news feed. PLUS, event hosts can view insights directly on the event page. \n\nSEE: Facebook now lets Pages create News Feed ads to promote Events on desktop and mobile via The Next Web\nhttp://thenextweb.com/facebook/2014/08/28/facebook-now-lets-pages-create-news-feed-ads-promote-events-desktop-mobile/\n\n\u2462 \u201cBUY\u201d BUTTON ON ADS\n\nFacebook is testing a new \u201cBuy\u201d button on ads (desktop and mobile) and page posts. \n\nSEE: Facebook\u2019s Buy button and the future of global commerce via InsideFacebook.com\nhttp://www.insidefacebook.com/2014/08/19/facebooks-buy-button-and-the-future-of-global-commerce/\nAlso: https://www.facebook.com/business/news/Discover-and-Buy-Products-on-Facebook-Test\n\n\u2463 BANDWIDTH TARGETING\n\nIn order to more effectively reach people in high-growth countries, Facebook introduced bandwidth targeting to give advertisers the ability to place ads based on the quality of a user\u2019s network connection (whether 2G, 3G or 4G+), whatever they most often use when accessing Facebook.\n\nSEE: Facebook Turns On \u201cBandwidth Targeting\u201d To Match Mobile Ads To Your Network Quality via TechCrunch\nhttp://techcrunch.com/2014/08/27/facebook-turns-on-bandwidth-targeting-to-match-mobile-ads-to-network-quality/\n\n\u2464 NEWS FEED AD FREQUENCY DOUBLES\n\nFacebook quietly altered its ad policy to allow brands to show the same news feed ad twice in a given day, whereas previously brands were only able to do so once per day. In addition, brands can show news feed ads twice daily (instead of once daily) to users who don\u2019t already follow the brand, e.g. Suggested Posts. \n\nSEE: Facebook raises the frequency cap on ads via DIGIDAY:\nhttp://digiday.com/platforms/facebook-frequency-cap/\n\n\u2465 CROSS-DEVICE REPORTING\n\nFacebook introduced cross-device reporting to help advertisers understand how their mobile ads influence consumers\u2019 desktop buying decisions. A Facebook blog post said that \"a marketer can view the number of customers that clicked an ad on an iPhone but then later converted on desktop, or the number of people that saw an ad on desktop but then converted on an Android tablet.\"\n\nSEE: Facebook Wants to Show That Mobile Ads Affect Desktop Purchases via Adweek\nhttp://www.adweek.com/news/technology/facebook-wants-show-mobile-ads-affect-desktop-purchases-159486\n\n\u2466 FACEBOOK ADS RESTRUCTURE\n\nStarting this month, Facebook is streamlining the ad process by rolling up all targeting and bidding to the Ad Set level. The new structure looks like this:\nCampaign: Objective\nAd Set: Schedule, Budget, Bidding, Targeting and Placement\nAd: Creative\n\nSEE: Facebook Updates Campaign Structure Again: New Ad Sets and Ads via Jon Loomer Digital\nhttp://www.jonloomer.com/2014/08/19/new-facebook-campaign-structure/\n\n\u2467 MEASURE 20% TEXT IN ADS\n\nFacebook added a grid tool to its Ads Manager to help page administrators determine whether their ads violate the 20 percent rule on how much text they can contain. (It's not clear if all advertisers now have access to this tool, or when it's coming). \n\nSEE: Facebook Adds Grid Tool to Ads Manager to Determine If Ads Violate 20 Percent Text Rule via AllFacebook.com\nhttp://allfacebook.com/grid-tool-ads-manager-20-percent-text-rule_b134244\n\n= = = = =\n\nDid I miss anything?!

I purposely made this an IMAGE post so that when you share it, the entire narrative comes with the post. (Shared link posts do not bring the narrative with them.) Plus, because there are so many links in this post, if I made it a native link post (with preview) and you went to Save it, it would only save one link. <sigh> Such is the way the new Save feature works.

I have been teaching my self everything from Hootsuite, to Iconogram, Facebook marketing, Instagram, Twitter marketing, and whatever else I can get my hands on within the last month.  Your website and this page has been a huge part of my learning and I thank you so much for all of the valuable information you share.  \n\nI live in San Diego and I'm currently a full time student, getting my BS in Web Development and soon to be working towards an AA and possibly a BA in Advertising...depending on my GI Bill benefits.  But I've been bitten by the social media bug and hope to be getting my first client in a couple weeks already! Lol.  Not sure I fully know what I'm doing yet but I'm gonna get out there and just go for it!\n\nWell I just saw your ad on Social Media Marketing World and I want to GO!!!!  But it's too expensive for this Air Force vet and now full time student.      :(  Is there any possible way I can sneak in? Lol.  I promise to be social! :)  Oh, I have an idea...I can sing you \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\" with my ukulele like brada IZ!?  I play at a local restaurant on most Friday nights so I swear, I'm pretty good at it.  ;)  \n\nWell, I figured it's worth a try...lol.  At the very least, I thank you for reading my post and I truly wish you all an extremely successful event!
