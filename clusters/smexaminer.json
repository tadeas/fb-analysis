You certainly want to protect this asset and prevent unwanted visitors from stealing your Facebook Page!\n\nHere are 3 ways to keep your Facebook Page secure:\n\n#1. Assign at least two Page Admins to your page. Whenever one of the Page Admins loses access to their Facebook Account, the other admin can still manage all aspects of a Facebook Page. Make sure you assign someone you can really trust! To learn more: https://www.facebook.com/help/274301846062270\n\n#2. Turn on login notifications / alerts. This prevents strangers from logging into your Facebook account from any unknown browser or device without you noticing this! If someone hacks your account, you receive a notification from Facebook as soon as they login to your account! To learn more:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/help/162968940433354\n\n#3. Turn on login approvals. This adds extra security to your Facebook account. When someone hacks your account, they can not login to your Facebook account without receiving a special login code (send to your mobile phone via text message).

Mari Smith. 7 Recent Changes to Facebook Ads - get up to speed quickly with this roundup of new features and changes that may impact your advertising on Facebook! [Update: added #8 below!]\n\n\u2460 MANAGE ADS ON THE GO\n\nAdvertisers can now manage ads with Ads Manager on mobile devices. Using your Facebook native app, look for the Ads Manager bookmark.\n \nSEE: A New Way to Manage Facebook Ads on the Go via Facebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/business/news/manage-facebook-ads-on-the-go\n\n\u2461 EVENT ADS\n\nPreviously, event ads were only shown in the right-hand column on desktop. Now pages can create event ads for desktop and mobile news feed. PLUS, event hosts can view insights directly on the event page. \n\nSEE: Facebook now lets Pages create News Feed ads to promote Events on desktop and mobile via The Next Web\nhttp://thenextweb.com/facebook/2014/08/28/facebook-now-lets-pages-create-news-feed-ads-promote-events-desktop-mobile/\n\n\u2462 \u201cBUY\u201d BUTTON ON ADS\n\nFacebook is testing a new \u201cBuy\u201d button on ads (desktop and mobile) and page posts. \n\nSEE: Facebook\u2019s Buy button and the future of global commerce via InsideFacebook.com\nhttp://www.insidefacebook.com/2014/08/19/facebooks-buy-button-and-the-future-of-global-commerce/\nAlso: https://www.facebook.com/business/news/Discover-and-Buy-Products-on-Facebook-Test\n\n\u2463 BANDWIDTH TARGETING\n\nIn order to more effectively reach people in high-growth countries, Facebook introduced bandwidth targeting to give advertisers the ability to place ads based on the quality of a user\u2019s network connection (whether 2G, 3G or 4G+), whatever they most often use when accessing Facebook.\n\nSEE: Facebook Turns On \u201cBandwidth Targeting\u201d To Match Mobile Ads To Your Network Quality via TechCrunch\nhttp://techcrunch.com/2014/08/27/facebook-turns-on-bandwidth-targeting-to-match-mobile-ads-to-network-quality/\n\n\u2464 NEWS FEED AD FREQUENCY DOUBLES\n\nFacebook quietly altered its ad policy to allow brands to show the same news feed ad twice in a given day, whereas previously brands were only able to do so once per day. In addition, brands can show news feed ads twice daily (instead of once daily) to users who don\u2019t already follow the brand, e.g. Suggested Posts. \n\nSEE: Facebook raises the frequency cap on ads via DIGIDAY:\nhttp://digiday.com/platforms/facebook-frequency-cap/\n\n\u2465 CROSS-DEVICE REPORTING\n\nFacebook introduced cross-device reporting to help advertisers understand how their mobile ads influence consumers\u2019 desktop buying decisions. A Facebook blog post said that \"a marketer can view the number of customers that clicked an ad on an iPhone but then later converted on desktop, or the number of people that saw an ad on desktop but then converted on an Android tablet.\"\n\nSEE: Facebook Wants to Show That Mobile Ads Affect Desktop Purchases via Adweek\nhttp://www.adweek.com/news/technology/facebook-wants-show-mobile-ads-affect-desktop-purchases-159486\n\n\u2466 FACEBOOK ADS RESTRUCTURE\n\nStarting this month, Facebook is streamlining the ad process by rolling up all targeting and bidding to the Ad Set level. The new structure looks like this:\nCampaign: Objective\nAd Set: Schedule, Budget, Bidding, Targeting and Placement\nAd: Creative\n\nSEE: Facebook Updates Campaign Structure Again: New Ad Sets and Ads via Jon Loomer Digital\nhttp://www.jonloomer.com/2014/08/19/new-facebook-campaign-structure/\n\n\u2467 MEASURE 20% TEXT IN ADS\n\nFacebook added a grid tool to its Ads Manager to help page administrators determine whether their ads violate the 20 percent rule on how much text they can contain. (It's not clear if all advertisers now have access to this tool, or when it's coming). \n\nSEE: Facebook Adds Grid Tool to Ads Manager to Determine If Ads Violate 20 Percent Text Rule via AllFacebook.com\nhttp://allfacebook.com/grid-tool-ads-manager-20-percent-text-rule_b134244\n\n= = = = =\n\nDid I miss anything?!

I purposely made this an IMAGE post so that when you share it, the entire narrative comes with the post. (Shared link posts do not bring the narrative with them.) Plus, because there are so many links in this post, if I made it a native link post (with preview) and you went to Save it, it would only save one link. <sigh> Such is the way the new Save feature works. For more info on the Save feature, see this post: http://www.marismith.com/5-things-businesses-need-to-know-about-facebooks-new-save-feature/\n\nOf course, this would make a great blog post...

Facebook is set to launch Timeline for Brand Pages imminently, two sources tell us, with a possible official announcement on Feb. 29, one source says, when the social network holds its invitation only Facebook Marketing Conference.\n\n!! What are your thoughts about Facebook Timeline coming to pages?! ~J Jakolien Sok. Boosting Your Brand. BREAKING FACEBOOK NEWS! Facebook is set to launch Timeline for Brand Pages imminently, two sources tell us, with a possible official announcement on Feb. 29, one source says, when the social network holds its invitation only Facebook Marketing Conference.\n\nFacebook is already in the process of forcing Timeline on its individual users globally over the next few weeks. The next logical step is for that rollout to reach Brand Pages.\n\nTimeline for individual users essentially redesigns your Facebook page, turning every status update and photo post into a single, long, visually appealing \"narrative\" of your life.\n\n\"At Facebook they pushed back the launch of Timeline for brands to the end of February,\" a source who has been briefed by Facebook ad sales executives told us. The source noted the Feb. 29 \"fMC\" confab, hosted by vp/global ad sales Carolyn Everson (pictured), and added \"Those two pieces of information are too much of a coincidence.\"\n\nThe second source said, \"Timeline is coming to Brand Pages,\" and added that many marketers remain ignorant of how it's going to work and how it may affect them. \"Most people don't even know.\"\nA Facebook spokesperson said: \"...we believe that consistency in both functionality and appearance increase use of Facebook.  We hope to make Pages more consistent with the Timeline in the future, but we have nothing further to share at this time.\"\n\n!! What are your thoughts about Facebook Timeline coming to pages?! ~Jakolien Sok\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource:\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-preparing-launch-of-timeline-for-brand-pages-2012-1",
