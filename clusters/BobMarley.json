          "Film/video director & music documentarian Don Letts recalls his first time seeing Bob live and meeting him afterwards: \n\n\"I went to Bob Marley\u2019s legendary gig at the Lyceum in \u201975 which was released as a live album. It was the closest I have ever got to a religious experience and the single most exciting music moment of my life. The full impact and reality of what we had heard on his records all came together in that show. It was no longer an abstract thing that you could interpret one way or another. Here was the man onstage delivering it live and direct. It gave me the confidence to be myself. Bob Marley brought the politic to the forefront of reggae with a militant Rasta rebel vibe. After the gig I followed Bob Marley in my car back to his hotel in Harrington Gardens, off Gloucester Road. I don\u2019t know what possessed me, I marched into the hotel with all the other Rasta brethren. Everyone was sitting down and I found a little spot in the corner. Bob was holding court in his room and was smoking and \u2018reasoning\u2019 with all the Rasta elders. Finally, it was three or four in the morning and Bob had out-reasoned and out-smoked everybody. He looked around the room and saw me with my baby dreads and my pathetic little bag of smoke. I was called to the table and \u2018reasoned\u2019 with him until sunrise.\" Timeline Photos",

Now as a musician, I owe so much to Bob for telling me to, \"Wake up and Live..Don't bury your thoughts, put your vision to reality.\" Bob helped me to deeply understand that action needs to be taken in order to change the world. I hope to change the world through the music I create just as Bob did with an attitude of positive thought and action. Thank you Bob for showing me that I have the power to be the creator of my own destiny. \"Every man got a right to decide his own destiny...soon we will find out who is the true revolutionaries\"....This is the truth Bob help me to find and live with in all that I do. \"\n\nOne more question left, and if you liked the \"One Love\" image, it is available for download free at: http://bobmarley.com/free_stuff_booklets.php Timeline Photos",
