Check it out here: http://youtu.be/r0ivbQz3IGI\n \nCommented NIGHTWISH keyboard player and main songwriter Tuomas Holopainen: \u201cThis must be the sixth or seventh time we\u2019re working with these people. We\u2019ve realized what they can do during these years. So it\u2019s really not a surprise anymore but it hasn\u2019t ceased to amaze me. The level of professionalism is just unbelievable. But even more importantly, they clearly like what they\u2019re doing. The guys we\u2019ve worked with for over 10 years are still up for it.\u201d \n \nAdded session-drummer Kai Hahto: \u201cThe professionalism is amazing. We were recording ethnic percussion yesterday. Some of the guys had played on Star Wars movies \u2013 and done Hans Zimmer soundtracks. I thought of myself as a humppa drummer. It was pretty amazing. They know their prima vista. You give them the notation, and they\u2019ll nail it in no time.\u201d\n \nNIGHTWISH also revealed the famed evolutionary biologist and atheist writer/leader Richard Dawkins as a guest on their eighth studio album.\n \nAdditionally the band announced their North American tour for April and May 2015.

And a strange insect on your hand. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this. It\u2019s a wondrous place.\u201d\n\nAdded vocalist Floor Jansen: \u201cI am very sensitive about environment. Don\u2019t put me in the middle of a city and maybe super shiny, fantastic studio and keep me inspired for weeks. But a place like this does. I love nature and I love calm. We can work for hours and then you can relax.\u201d\n\nNIGHTWISH just recently announced their North American tour for April and May 2015.

The yet-untitled creation will be the first NIGHTWISH studio-record to feature Dutch vocalist Floor Jansen. Longtime drummer Jukka Nevalainen will sit out on the recording sessions due to health issues; Kai Hahto (WINTERSUN u.a.) will replace him. It\u2019s set for a release in spring 2015 via Nuclear Blast.\n \nToday the band put up the fourth album trailer, check it out here: www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJF4Twus_08\n \nCommented drummer Jukka Nevalainen on the first actual band rehearsal: \u201cYou have to remember that the last time we played together was about 11 months ago. It\u2019s been quite a while. So, all things considered out initial stabs were pretty OK.\u201d\nAdded guitarist Emppu Vuorinen: \u201cYou start to get into the songs when you rehearse them. We played a heavier tune, and it did get me moshing a bit. I don\u2019t know if it has something to do with age \u2013 but the need to show off has diminished even more. It\u2019s more like you want to do justice to the song and not strut your stuff.\u201d\n \nAlso check out:\n \nTrailer #1 \u2013 The Cabin:                                             www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB1IrA8FwrY \nTrailer #2 \u2013 By The Lake:                                          www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIhsFClj0U4\nTrailer #3 \u2013 Inside His Head:                                    www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQ9PFUZ9uGs\nSpecial Clip #1: 'Planet Hell':                                   http://youtu.be/CRJ_csyXosU\nSpecial Clip #2: 'Last Of The Wilds':                         \nhttp://youtu.be/A-Djx6iZ70g\n \nYou can order the most current NIGHTWISH release, \u00bbShowtime, Storytime\u00ab, at this destination: http://smarturl.it/NIGHTWISHShowtime\nor from the official Nightwish Shop at:                 http://shop.nightwish.com\nor via iTunes (live album incl. digital booklet):     http://georiot.co/2SNi\n \nwww.nightwish.com | www.facebook.com/nightwish | www.nuclearblast.de/nightwish\n  NIGHTWISH - Making of new album 2015; Episode 4 (OFFICIAL TRAILER) A NEW NIGHTWISH ALBUM IS COMING!

          "New album in the making, first trailer online!\n\nSit back and fasten your fairytale seatbelts, as of today NIGHTWISH reveal a first glimpse into their new album. The yet-untitled creation will be the first NIGHTWISH studio-record to feature Dutch vocalist Floor Jansen. It\u2019s set for a release in spring 2015 via Nuclear Blast.\n\nCheck out the first \u201cMaking of\u201d trailer here: http://youtu.be/BB1IrA8FwrY \n\nEnjoy the ride, as NIGHTWISH take you on a trip to where the magic happens: Settled right in the middle of the beautiful wintery landscape of Eno, Finland, band members and sound staff gather round the long table of \u201cthe Cabin\u201d to discuss every aspect, relevant for the making of NIGHTWISH album #8. So far the bands\u2019 mastermind, keyboardist and visionary composer Tuomas Holopainen and sound engineer Tero \u201cTeeCee\u201d Kinnunen recorded demo version of 12 songs.\n\nCommented Tuomas Holopainen: \u201cFrom the moment I start writing the song, I have the story in my head. I have a really clear vision how the songs should sound like at this point. Of course they will chance after band rehearsals and arranging. And they should change!\u201d\n\nMore \u201cMaking of\u201d episodes to come, so keep your eyes peeled to the Nuclear Blast YouTube channel!\n\nYou can order the most current NIGHTWISH release, \u00bbShowtime, Storytime\u00ab, at this destination:  http://smarturl.it/NIGHTWISHShowtime\nor from the official Nightwish Shop at:  http://shop.nightwish.com\nor via iTunes (live album incl. digital booklet):  http://georiot.co/2SNi\n\nwww.nightwish.com | www.facebook.com/nightwish | www.nuclearblast.de/nightwish\n\nNIGHTWISH \u2013 arbeiten an neuem Album, erster Trailer online!\n\nLehnt euch zur\u00fcck und schnallt euch fest an, denn heute geben NIGHTWISH einen ersten Einblick in ihr neues, bevorstehendes Album. Das bisher noch unbetitelte Epos ist das erste NIGHTWISH Studioalbum, auf dem die niederl\u00e4ndische S\u00e4ngerin Floor Jansen vertreten ist. Erscheinen soll das Werk im Fr\u00fchjahr 2015 via Nuclear Blast.\n\nDen ersten \u201cMaking of\u201d Trailer k\u00f6nnt ihr hier sehen: http://youtu.be/BB1IrA8FwrY \n\nGenie\u00dft die Reise, denn NIGHTWISH nehmen euch mit an magischen Ort: Inmitten der wundervollen Winterlandschaft im finnischen Eno, versammeln sich Bandmitglieder und Soundt\u00fcftler, um alle Aspekte zu besprechen, die f\u00fcr die Entstehung des achten NIGHTWISH Longplayers relevant sind. Bisher hat Bandleader, Keyboarder und Kompositionsvision\u00e4r Tuomas Holopainen zusammen mit Toningenieur Tero \u201cTeeCee\u201d Kinnunen Demoversionen von 12 Songs aufgenommen. \n\nDazu Tuomas Holopainen: \u201cVon dem Moment an, wenn ich einen Song schreibe, habe ich die Geschichte dazu im Kopf. Ich habe eine klare Vorstellung davon, wie die Songs klingen sollen. Nat\u00fcrlich ver\u00e4ndern sich die Songs mit jeder Probe und jedem neuem Arrangement. Und so soll es auch sein!\u201c\n\nWeitere \u201cMaking of\u201d Folgen kommen bald, also haltet eure Augen auf und besucht regelm\u00e4\u00dfig den Nuclear Blast YouTube Kanal!\n\nDas aktuelleste NIGHTWISH Werk \u00bbShowtime, Storytime\u00ab, k\u00f6nnt ihr unter folgendem Link bestellen:                                                                        http://smarturl.it/NIGHTWISHShowtime\nOder im Nightwish Shop:                                           http://shop.nightwish.com\nOder via iTunes (live album inkl. digital booklet):    http://georiot.co/2SNi\n\nwww.nightwish.com | www.facebook.com/nightwish | www.nuclearblast.de/nightwish Timeline Photos",

          "We're getting closer to the release of Endless Forms Most Beautiful (out on March 27th (EU), 30th (UK) and 31st (US))!!! We'd like to share more about the themes and the inspiration of the album in this twelfth \u201cmaking-of\u201d trailer!\nCheck it out here: http://youtu.be/3hSB4ENrQKc\n\nTuomas comments: \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of scientific approach to a lot of things on the album. Songs like \u2018Shudder Before The Beautiful\u2019, \u2018Endless Forms Most Beautiful\u2019, \u2018The Greatest Show On Earth\u2019 or \u2018Alpenglow\u2019 all somehow reflect the bliss of existence. It\u2019s temporary character. Evolution\u2026Maybe you could even talk about the poetic nature of science. Natural science and its paradigm \u2013 seem to represent something cold and boring to a lot of people. Hopefully we can illustrate with this album \u2013 that science can even be something profoundly spiritual.\u201d\n \nStand-in drummer Kai Hahto adds: \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect theme to an album. Like, how did we come to be? And when our time here is done, what kind of mark do we leave? It\u2019s a pretty amazing theme.\u201d\n \nThe track list for \u00bbEndless Forms Most Beautiful\u00ab reads as follows:\n \n01. Shudder Before The Beautiful\n02. Weak Fantasy\n03. \u00c9lan\n04.

I had more fun than ever during the recordings. The R\u00f6sk\u00f6 summer camp was a lot of fun. The days were filled with friendship, hope and music. Obviously the sad thing was that Jukka had to step aside \u2013 but everything else has been really good.\u201d\nAnd Marco added: \u201cThe songs did grow during the process. We started out with Tuomas\u2019 computer demos and my own demos. We put them together \u2013 and started building the songs around those basic blocks. They really grew in depth and character along the way.\u201d\nWe recently revealed the track listing and different formats of \u00bbEndless Forms Most Beautiful\u00ab which will be released as follows:\nJewelcase\n01.

The underlying theme of the song is nothing less than the meaning of life, which can be something different for all of us. It\u00b4s important to surrender yourself to the occasional 'free fall' and not to fear the path less travelled by. '\u00c9lan' is a wonderful teaser for the full-length album, giving out a little taste, but revealing very little of the actual Journey of Grandeur to come\u2026\u201d\n\n\u2018\u00c9lan\u2019 tracklisting:\n\nCD:\n1. \u00c9lan (album version)\n2. \u00c9lan (radio edit)\n3. \u00c9lan (alternate version)\n4.

Nightwish and Anette Olzon have decided to part company, in mutual understanding, for the good of all parties involved.\n\nIn recent times it has become increasingly obvious that the direction and the needs of the band were in conflict, and this has led to a division from which we cannot recover.\n\nNightwish has no intention of cancelling any upcoming shows, and as a result we have decided to bring in a substitute vocalist starting in Seattle 1.10.2012. Her name is Floor Jansen from The Netherlands (ex-After Forever, ReVamp), and she has graciously stepped in to help us complete the Imaginaerum world tour.\n\nWe are all strongly committed to this journey, this vehicle of spirit, and we are sure that this will lead to a brighter future for everyone.\n\nWe forever remain excited about the adventures to come, and we are extremely proud of the two beautiful albums and the wonderful shows we shared together.\n\n- NIGHTWISH & Anette Olzon",

Imaginaerum by Nightwish @ Hartwall Areena, Helsinki, Finland WORLD PREMIERE OF IMAGINAERUM THE MOVIE AND CONCERT ANNOUNCED AT HARTWALL ARENA, HELSINKI, FINLAND, ON NOVEMBER 10, 2012\n\nThe long-awaited Nightwish movie Imaginaerum will have its \u201cflying\u201d premiere at Hartwall Arena, Helsinki, Finland, on November 10, 2012, as the audience will be treated to both a full-scale Nightwish concert and the world premiere of the movie.\n\nEagerly anticipated around the world, Imaginaerum creates a musical fantasy world in the vein of David Lynch, Neil Gaiman, and Cirque du Soleil. The movie is an innovative mixture of story-telling and music, an extraordinary tale of the power of imagination\u2026 and what\u2019s ultimately important in life.\n\nShot and post-produced in Canada, the movie was directed by Stobe Harju and produced by Solar Films, and features appearances by all Nightwish members. The screenplay is based on a wild vision that Tuomas Holopainen, the mastermind of the band, devised after the album Dark Passion Play came out in 2007.\n\n\u201cI though of how we could take our expression that had already became pretty ambitious and grandiose to the next level, and that\u2019s when I knew I wanted to tell a story, and to tell it with love and piety.\u201d\n\nAccording to Holopainen, finishing the movie has been an eventful and challenging journey that has sometimes demanded superhuman dedication from the production crew.\n\n\u201cI want to already thank everyone from the bottom of my heart. Together we\u2019ve managed to create something innovative, strange, and timeless\u201d, Holopainen states.\n\nImaginaerum will be screened at the Hartwall Arena on November 10, preceded by a show by Nightwish themselves, their last concert in Finland this year. The Finnish theatrical premiere of the movie is scheduled for November 23.\n\nThe official soundtrack of the movie, Imaginaerum by Nightwish - The Score will be released on the day before the premiere, Friday, November 9. The album features 13 grandiose, unreleased re-interpretations of Imaginaerum tracks by Petri Alanko.\n\nNightwish have sold over seven million albums internationally and received over 60 Gold and Platinum awards, making them the most successful Finnish Rock band of all time.\n\nDirector Stobe Harju tells about the movie in Finnish: http://www.nightwish.com/en/movie/en/news/230812\n\nEvent production: Solar Films Inc. and Eastway Sound & Lighting.\n\nNIGHTWISH: PREMIERE OF IMAGINAERUM THE MOVIE AND CONCERT\nHartwall Areena, Helsinki (Areenankuja 1)\nSaturday, November 10, 2012\nDoors: 6 PM, Showtime: 8 PM, Movie: 10.15 PM.\nTickets: 59 \u20ac + costs\n\nTICKETS \nTickets available on Monday, September 10, 9 AM Finnish time (CET+2) from: www.lippu.fi\nPresale until September 6, 15 PM Finnish time (CET+2): www.menolippu.fi\nRating 12 (with parental guidance 10)\n\nwww.nightwish.com\n\nPRESS PHOTOS\nwww.solarfilms.com\nwww.eastway.fi/media",

The whole album will be based on a graphic novel called \u00bbThe Life And Times Of Scrooge McDuck\u00ab, written and illustrated by Don Rosa.\r\n\r\nTuomas comments: \u201cThis is my longtime dream come true, 14 years in the making. And a homage to one of the best storytellers of our time. Thank you for sharing this celebration of Life & Adventure!\"\r\n\r\nThis 12 - chapter book tells the life story of a certain Scrooge, from his early years in the 19th century Scotland to his adventures all around the world until the 1950`s. The story contains such immense depth, detail, wit and emotional power, that the moment Tuomas read it nearly 20 years ago, it instantly became a story of profound personal interest and love for him. The initial spark of `coloring` this story with music, i.e. create a kind of \"soundtrack\" for the book, came to him already in 1999, and has ever since been haunting the back of his mind.\r\n\r\nThe album was written and produced by Tuomas Holopainen and will contain 10 songs, with total duration of approximately 60 minutes. The music will be of soundtrack / classical / folk genre in the vein of Vaughan Williams, Michael Nyman, James Newton Howard and Enya.\r\n\r\nMr. Pip Williams has done the orchestral arrangements, continuing his collaboration with Tuomas after the NIGHTWISH records \u00bbOnce\u00ab, \u00bbDark Passion Play\u00ab & \u00bbImaginaerum\u00ab.\r\n\r\nThere will be a number of guest musicians, including the London Orchestra, The Metro Voices (a choir from London) and four lead vocalists: Alan Reid, Johanna Kurkela, Johanna Iivanainen & Tony Kakko. Other guest appearances include Troy Donockley (uilleann pipes, low whistles, bodhran), Mikko Iivanainen (guitars & banjo), Teho Majam\u00e4ki (Didgeridoo), Jon Burr (Harmonica) and Dermot Crehan in the solo violin.\r\nThe recordings took place during August - October 2013, first at Angel Studios, London, then in various locations around Scotland and Finland.\r\n\r\nThe author of the book, Don Rosa, has done the artwork for the album.\r\n\r\nThere will also be a single release, from the track \u2018A Lifetime Of Adventure\u2019, and a music video to go with it in early 2014.\r\nThe album \u00bbThe Life And Times Of Scrooge\u00ab is scheduled for a release in April 2014.

Richard Dawkins Interview From Wembley\n\nSold out arenas and spectacular shows with never before seen pyro effects, wind machines, video screens and of course NIGHTWISH's incomparable melodies are the elements that made their latest tour so unique. Special highlights for the band have been two particular shows though:\nThe one in London, where they not only played their hymns such as '\u00c9lan' and the majestic 'The Greatest Show On Earth' to more than 12.000 fans, but also welcomed the world famous scientist Richard Dawkins live on stage with them. Richard Dawkins\u00b4 works had a massive impact on the thematical orientation of their latest studio Album \u00bbEndless Forms Most Beautiful\u00ab.

          "NIGHTWISH will release a live DVD/BLU-RAY package \u201dVehicle Of Spirit\u201d \nin November 2016\n\nThe pre-sales will start on the 9th of September 2016.\n\nAfter touring for a year and a half throughout almost every corner of the world and leaving fans of all nationalities breathless, the time has come for NIGHTWISH to immortalize their \"Endless Forms Most Beautiful World Tour 2015-2016\" on DVD. Therefore, the symphonic metal visionaries are set to release their new live milestone \u00bbVehicle Of Spirit\u00ab on November 4th, featuring not only two full concerts, but also plenty of bonus material.\n\n\"The title \"Vehicle Of Spirit\" came from a friend of Troy's, who after seeing our show a few years ago defined NIGHTWISH as 'A vehicle of spirit that defies category'. That beautiful description has followed us ever since, and felt like a perfect match as the DVD title,\" states keyboardist and songwriter Tuomas Holopainen.\n\nSold out arenas and spectacular shows with never before seen pyro effects, wind machines, video screens and of course NIGHTWISH's incomparable melodies are the elements that made their latest tour so unique. \n\nSpecial highlights for the band have been two particular shows though: The one in London, where they not only played their hymns such as \"\u00c9lan\" and the majestic \"The Greatest Show On Earth\" to more than 12.000 fans, but also welcomed the world famous scientist Richard Dawkins live on stage with them. \n\nRichard Dawkins\u00b4 works had a massive impact on the thematical orientation of their latest studio album \u201dEndless Forms Most Beautiful\u201d. Finland's Tampere show however was a home run for the band and never before NIGHTWISH had such an immense stage production with them:\n\n\"I would say the main part of the DVD are those two shows, both Wembley and Tampere. Wembley is mentioned first due to its recognizability and legendary status. I remember the show being very special, both a goal achieved, and a starting point. The crowd was heartwarming. The presence of Richard Dawkins on stage was mind-blowing. The overall Wembley experience was a once-in-a-lifetime thrill ride!\nThe show in Ratina Stadion, Tampere, was a home crowd specialty (for 4/6th of the band) with the biggest stage production we've ever had. A lovely atmosphere throughout the concert, with many same faces in the front row as there were 15 years ago. Heartfelt.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the final artwork of the DVD, NIGHTWISH decided to walk different paths this time and come up with a little alternative idea, as Tuomas explains:\n\"We didn`t want to include a traditional band shot for the cover, as on the previous DVD release \u00bbShowtime, Storytime\u00ab. So we started brainstorming on different options and the idea of a classic silent movie era - Hollywood visuals quickly came up. With those classic slogans the cover has a little tongue-in-cheek-touch to it, but it's still classy and eye-catching in its simplicity and originality.\"\n\nCatch NIGHTWISH one more time on their \n\"Endless Forms Most Beautiful World Tour 2015-2016\u201d:\n\n06.08.

We were humbled and grateful at the same time. This is unity and help from friends and fans. Anette is already recovering thanks to the medical staff and whatever powers there exists. The shows will go on. We give our greatest respect to Alyssa, Elise and the crowd in Ogden Theatre, Denver. You rule!!!",

          "TO NIGHTWISH WITH LOVE - documentary from fans to their idols\n\n \n  \n\"This is a documentary that I'd like to see right away,\" said Tuomas Holopainen of NIGHTWISH upon hearing about the crowdsourcing project underway at Yle, Finland's national public broadcasting company. \n\nWhat are NIGHTWISH fans alike, where do they live, and what do they dream about? Filmed by the fans themselves, the documentary relates their passion, devotion and admiration for NIGHTWISH. This documentary is an international project that portrays the fans around the world.\n\nNIGHTWISH are one of most successful metal bands in Europe: the band's videos have had 680 million views on YouTube during the last fifteen months. The band has sold 8 million records, and their Facebook page has 4.4 million likes. The music of NIGHTWISH connects people across countries and continents. What are the fans alike, and what do they dream about?\n\nThe fans of NIGHTWISH answer these question themselves in this self-filmed documentary. The result is an honest, crazy and intimate documentary, one that could not be made under the pressure of a big film crew around. \"We received videos from fans from fifty countries,\" say the directors of the documentary, Kaisa Alenius and Harto H\u00e4nninen. \"The survival stories of the fans and their studies of the Finnish language finally led us to understand how tremendously important the band is to their fans.\"\n\nThe fans also produced material in the form of music, drawings and animations. This way, the fans became part of the band's story. \n\nThe premiere of TO NIGHTWISH WITH LOVE will be on 20th of August 2016. The crowdsourced documentary will be shown in Himos, Finland, at an event beginning at 1 p.m. Members of the band and some of the fans that provided material for the document will be present. \n\nYou can also take part in the event online on Yle Areena, the web channel where the documentary will have its premiere at the same time as it is shown at Himos. The documentary will be broadcasted online without geo-blocking, so NIGHTWISH fans around the world will be able to see it at the same time with their idols. Timeline Photos",
