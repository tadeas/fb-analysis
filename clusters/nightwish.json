The overall Wembley experience was a once-in-a-lifetime thrill ride!\nThe show in Ratina Stadion, Tampere, was a home crowd specialty (for 4/6th of the band) with the biggest stage production we've ever had. A lovely atmosphere throughout the concert, with many same faces in the front row as there were 15 years ago. Heartfelt.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the final artwork of the DVD, NIGHTWISH decided to walk different paths this time and come up with a little alternative idea, as Tuomas explains:\n\"We didn`t want to include a traditional band shot for the cover, as on the previous DVD release \u00bbShowtime, Storytime\u00ab. So we started brainstorming on different options and the idea of a classic silent movie era - Hollywood visuals quickly came up. With those classic slogans the cover has a little tongue-in-cheek-touch to it, but it's still classy and eye-catching in its simplicity and originality.\"\n\nCatch NIGHTWISH one more time on their \n\"Endless Forms Most Beautiful World Tour 2015-2016\u201d:\n\n06.08.

I would like you to know that being out of my house in the last few months has been extremely hard as I have recently been diagnosed with an extreme anxiety disorder.  I used to think that my life was over and I could no longer enjoy life like I used too.  You changed that for me! I am beyond ecstatic to say that I survived every minute of your concert without being medicated.  For those who suffer like I do,  you know that this is a ginormous step towards my future as a singer.  Tuomas.  You are my inspiration.  I would love to show you my singing sometime and get some feedback. I've got recordings.  Thank you thank you THANK YOU.  DALLAS TEXAS... you missed out of the greatest show of the century!!!!",

          "We're getting closer to the release of Endless Forms Most Beautiful (out on March 27th (EU), 30th (UK) and 31st (US))!!! We'd like to share more about the themes and the inspiration of the album in this twelfth \u201cmaking-of\u201d trailer!\nCheck it out here: http://youtu.be/3hSB4ENrQKc\n\nTuomas comments: \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of scientific approach to a lot of things on the album. Songs like \u2018Shudder Before The Beautiful\u2019, \u2018Endless Forms Most Beautiful\u2019, \u2018The Greatest Show On Earth\u2019 or \u2018Alpenglow\u2019 all somehow reflect the bliss of existence. It\u2019s temporary character. Evolution\u2026Maybe you could even talk about the poetic nature of science. Natural science and its paradigm \u2013 seem to represent something cold and boring to a lot of people. Hopefully we can illustrate with this album \u2013 that science can even be something profoundly spiritual.\u201d\n \nStand-in drummer Kai Hahto adds: \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect theme to an album. Like, how did we come to be? And when our time here is done, what kind of mark do we leave? It\u2019s a pretty amazing theme.\u201d\n \nThe track list for \u00bbEndless Forms Most Beautiful\u00ab reads as follows:\n \n01. Shudder Before The Beautiful\n02. Weak Fantasy\n03. \u00c9lan\n04. Yours Is An Empty Hope\n05. Our Decades In the Sun\n06. My Walden\n07. Endless Forms Most Beautiful\n08. Edema Ruh\n09. Alpenglow\n10. The Eyes Of Sharbat Gula\n11.

          "With the release of our new album 'Endless Forms Most Beautiful' at our doorstep we can today release our tenth album trailer.\nWe are counting down the days to the end of March of the release on the 27th (EU), 30th (UK) and 31st (US). But while looking into the future we look back to the recording of this album in this 10th trailer.\nCheck it out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YoyRFF3KY\nHere is a personal comment on this episode by Tuomas: \n\u201cThe writing process was extremely smooth and relatively easy. I had more fun than ever during the recordings. The R\u00f6sk\u00f6 summer camp was a lot of fun. The days were filled with friendship, hope and music. Obviously the sad thing was that Jukka had to step aside \u2013 but everything else has been really good.\u201d\nAnd Marco added: \u201cThe songs did grow during the process. We started out with Tuomas\u2019 computer demos and my own demos. We put them together \u2013 and started building the songs around those basic blocks. They really grew in depth and character along the way.\u201d\nWe recently revealed the track listing and different formats of \u00bbEndless Forms Most Beautiful\u00ab which will be released as follows:\nJewelcase\n01. Shudder Before The Beautiful\n02. Weak Fantasy\n03. \u00c9lan\n04. Yours Is An Empty Hope\n05. Our Decades In the Sun\n06. My Walden\n07. Endless Forms Most Beautiful\n08. Edema Ruh\n09.

It\u00b4s important to surrender yourself to the occasional 'free fall' and not to fear the path less travelled by. '\u00c9lan' is a wonderful teaser for the full-length album, giving out a little taste, but revealing very little of the actual Journey of Grandeur to come\u2026\u201d\n\n\u2018\u00c9lan\u2019 tracklisting:\n\nCD:\n1. \u00c9lan (album version)\n2. \u00c9lan (radio edit)\n3. \u00c9lan (alternate version)\n4.

WORLD PREMIERE OF IMAGINAERUM THE MOVIE AND CONCERT ANNOUNCED AT HARTWALL ARENA, HELSINKI, FINLAND, ON NOVEMBER 10, 2012\n\nThe long-awaited Nightwish movie Imaginaerum will have its \u201cflying\u201d premiere at Hartwall Arena, Helsinki, Finland, on November 10, 2012, as the audience will be treated to both a full-scale Nightwish concert and the world premiere of the movie.\n\nEagerly anticipated around the world, Imaginaerum creates a musical fantasy world in the vein of David Lynch, Neil Gaiman, and Cirque du Soleil. The movie is an innovative mixture of story-telling and music, an extraordinary tale of the power of imagination\u2026 and what\u2019s ultimately important in life.\n\nShot and post-produced in Canada, the movie was directed by Stobe Harju and produced by Solar Films, and features appearances by all Nightwish members. The screenplay is based on a wild vision that Tuomas Holopainen, the mastermind of the band, devised after the album Dark Passion Play came out in 2007.\n\n\u201cI though of how we could take our expression that had already became pretty ambitious and grandiose to the next level, and that\u2019s when I knew I wanted to tell a story, and to tell it with love and piety.\u201d\n\nAccording to Holopainen, finishing the movie has been an eventful and challenging journey that has sometimes demanded superhuman dedication from the production crew.\n\n\u201cI want to already thank everyone from the bottom of my heart. Together we\u2019ve managed to create something innovative, strange, and timeless\u201d, Holopainen states.\n\nImaginaerum will be screened at the Hartwall Arena on November 10, preceded by a show by Nightwish themselves, their last concert in Finland this year. The Finnish theatrical premiere of the movie is scheduled for November 23.\n\nThe official soundtrack of the movie, Imaginaerum by Nightwish - The Score will be released on the day before the premiere, Friday, November 9. The album features 13 grandiose, unreleased re-interpretations of Imaginaerum tracks by Petri Alanko.\n\nNightwish have sold over seven million albums internationally and received over 60 Gold and Platinum awards, making them the most successful Finnish Rock band of all time.\n\nDirector Stobe Harju tells about the movie in Finnish: http://www.nightwish.com/en/movie/en/news/230812\n\nEvent production: Solar Films Inc. and Eastway Sound & Lighting.\n\nNIGHTWISH: PREMIERE OF IMAGINAERUM THE MOVIE AND CONCERT\nHartwall Areena, Helsinki (Areenankuja 1)\nSaturday, November 10, 2012\nDoors: 6 PM, Showtime: 8 PM, Movie: 10.15 PM.\nTickets: 59 \u20ac + costs\n\nTICKETS \nTickets available on Monday, September 10, 9 AM Finnish time (CET+2) from: www.lippu.fi\nPresale until September 6, 15 PM Finnish time (CET+2): www.menolippu.fi\nRating 12 (with parental guidance 10)\n\nwww.nightwish.com\n\nPRESS PHOTOS\nwww.solarfilms.com\nwww.eastway.fi/media.",

Check it out here: http://youtu.be/xPoVHMT2Gcc\n \nCommented keyboard player and main songwriter Tuomas Holopainen: \u201cWe are actually ahead of our schedule. Incredibly, Floor has sung about two songs a day. Marco cut the final bass parts in 1.5 days and Emppudid the rhythm guitars in a week. I think it was because everything was so well-rehearsed this time. We\u2019ve tried to work more like a band.\u201d\n \nAdded vocalist Floor Jansen: \u201cTuomas challenged me, using everything I have to offer. High, low, soft, whatever, but definitely lower stuff and very soft and intimate things. Something that more by coincidence was something that I kind of missed doing. Something I haven\u2019t explored much and Tuomas wrote parts where I have to use this completely, where I have to go into it entirely. I\u2019m very happy with what came out there.\u201d\n\nMore recent news:\nWe revealed the famed evolutionary biologist and atheist writer/leader Richard Dawkins as a guest on our eighth studio album.\n \nAnd we announced our North American tour for April and May 2015 together with Sabaton and Delain!

          "TUOMAS HOLOPAINEN \u2013 First details about the solo album \u00bbThe Life And Times Of Scrooge\u00ab\r\n\r\nTuomas has spent most of the year 2013 writing and producing his solo album. The whole album will be based on a graphic novel called \u00bbThe Life And Times Of Scrooge McDuck\u00ab, written and illustrated by Don Rosa.\r\n\r\nTuomas comments: \u201cThis is my longtime dream come true, 14 years in the making. And a homage to one of the best storytellers of our time. Thank you for sharing this celebration of Life & Adventure!\"\r\n\r\nThis 12 - chapter book tells the life story of a certain Scrooge, from his early years in the 19th century Scotland to his adventures all around the world until the 1950`s. The story contains such immense depth, detail, wit and emotional power, that the moment Tuomas read it nearly 20 years ago, it instantly became a story of profound personal interest and love for him. The initial spark of `coloring` this story with music, i.e. create a kind of \"soundtrack\" for the book, came to him already in 1999, and has ever since been haunting the back of his mind.\r\n\r\nThe album was written and produced by Tuomas Holopainen and will contain 10 songs, with total duration of approximately 60 minutes. The music will be of soundtrack / classical / folk genre in the vein of Vaughan Williams, Michael Nyman, James Newton Howard and Enya.\r\n\r\nMr. Pip Williams has done the orchestral arrangements, continuing his collaboration with Tuomas after the NIGHTWISH records \u00bbOnce\u00ab, \u00bbDark Passion Play\u00ab & \u00bbImaginaerum\u00ab.\r\n\r\nThere will be a number of guest musicians, including the London Orchestra, The Metro Voices (a choir from London) and four lead vocalists: Alan Reid, Johanna Kurkela, Johanna Iivanainen & Tony Kakko. Other guest appearances include Troy Donockley (uilleann pipes, low whistles, bodhran), Mikko Iivanainen (guitars & banjo), Teho Majam\u00e4ki (Didgeridoo), Jon Burr (Harmonica) and Dermot Crehan in the solo violin.\r\nThe recordings took place during August - October 2013, first at Angel Studios, London, then in various locations around Scotland and Finland.\r\n\r\nThe author of the book, Don Rosa, has done the artwork for the album.\r\n\r\nThere will also be a single release, from the track \u2018A Lifetime Of Adventure\u2019, and a music video to go with it in early 2014.\r\nThe album \u00bbThe Life And Times Of Scrooge\u00ab is scheduled for a release in April 2014.
