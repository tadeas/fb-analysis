I noticed today while using my phone that if you type in the word \u5916\u56fd\u4eba (gaikokujin, foreigner), autocomplete offers an emoticon of a person with a big nose as a suggestion for input. This is similar to typing in \u30cf\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc (\"happy\") and getting an option for a smiley face, except you know, racism. The same racist emoticon pops up if you type in \u5916\u4eba, which literally means outsider and is a racial epithet directed towards minorities. \n\nThis is a preset feature, so I was wondering if you could help me understand where this racist smutt is coming from, and who to contact about it. (Pics or it didn't happen, so please see attached screencap.) Certainly the Android development team isn't espousing this sort of racism, right?",

Way home to Prague, I had bought a ticket with a transfer in Istanbul on 30th October. On this day in some European countries there is a shift of time, but in Turkey this year abolished the shift, but my phone synchronized time as if a shift has occurred and thus I missed my flight to Prague. It meant staying another day in Istanbul, where (because of my stupidity and probably some kind of drug in the tea) I has become a victim of typical fraud Istanbul.
