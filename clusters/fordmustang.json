          "Ford Mustang's in the past were noted mainly for their GT, muscle cars! This all changed dramatically with the 2011 V-6 Mustang! The replacement V-6 was a healthy 3.7 that boasted an impressive 305 hp while achieving a 30 -mpg EPA rating on the highway. It easily outclassed the previous V-6's 210 hp and 24 mpg highway rating. The replacement V-6 was the 3.7-liter (227-cubic-inch) unit familiar from recent Dearborn products like the Lincoln MKS premium-large sedan. Re-engineered for the rear-drive Mustang, it arrived with 305 hp and 285 pound-feet of torque, nearly as muscular as the previous GT V-8 and up 95 hp and 45 pound-feet from the ousted 4.0. The new V-6 engine featured weight-saving all-aluminum construction, port fuel injection, and twin overhead camshafts operating four valves per cylinder via Ti-VCT, Ford's new Twin Independent-Variable Cam Timing system, effective on both intake and exhaust sides. Comparing manual-shift V-6 coupes, C/D clocked 0-60s and quarter-miles of 5.4 seconds and 14 at 104 mph for Mustang ! Ford termed the new V-6 \"a mostly brilliant product (that) can satisfy just about anyone \".            \"The new Mustang V-6 can sprint with musclecars, zigzag with sports cars, and drink with economy cars. The best of all world's? You could say that. \" ----MOTOR TREND.",
