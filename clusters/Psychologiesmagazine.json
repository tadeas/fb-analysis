Out now\nAdd a new female heroine to your list: Harriet Burden, the \u2018rejected\u2019 artist who decides to play a gigantic revenge trick on the art world \u2013 she exhibits her work behind the masks of male artists to prove a point about gender bias, something that ultimately gets her into serious trouble. Via her diaries and the accounts of friends, enemies and academics who discuss her life and work, we enjoy fascinating snatches of psychology, neuroscience, feminism and philosophy. But this is also a mystery novel \u2013 we are asked to try and figure out just what kind of psychological game was being played. Burden is an angry woman, one with \u2018ideas dancing in her head like fireflies\u2019, and her fiery rage is \u2013 like feminism itself \u2013 at turns frustrating and moving but always meaningful, wonderful to experience. Those ideas that spill from every page are Husvedt\u2019s too, of course, a writer who deserves more and more of our precious time. Timeline Photos",

But that wasn\u2019t always the case \u2013 she had an older brother, Lowell, and an older sister, Fern. But Fern disappeared and Lowell ran away, leaving Rosemary to be brought up alone by her scientist parents. What starts off as a seemingly traditional narrative about a slightly unusual family suddenly grabs you by the throat and throws you off a cliff, as you desperately flip back through the pages to absorb a truly shocking twist. Without giving the plot away (because it\u2019s a corker), <We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves> is a moving portrait of an American family, and raises questions and feelings you never knew you had \u2013 about humanity, psychology and love in all its forms. It is a masterful novel, painful and memorable, and, like all the best novels, it will stay with you long afterwards. By Stacey Bartlett\n\n#books #review #worldbookday Timeline Photos",

As we get to know the pair, his father constantly tense and Alton seeming much wiser than the usual eight-year-old, we come to realise that there is more to this little boy than first meets the eye.\nWhen it transpires that the FBI are after him as well as the cult leader, and his strange powers become apparent, just like his family, you\u2019ll be rooting for him to find where he belongs in the world.\nWith an amazing score, an incredible cast including Kirstin Dunst and Adam Driver, and themes around family and what we sacrifice for the ones we love and the things we believe in, this is a realistic sci-fi movie guaranteed to keep you gripped until the end.

The Psychologies Film Club gives you the opportunity to interact with your tribe and discuss films - themes, storylines and characters with other Psychologies followers. This month, we're watching \u2018The Invisible Woman\u2019 starring Felicity Jones and Ralph Fiennes.\n\n**Psychologies FILM CLUB: The Invisible Woman**\n\nOut in UK cinemas 7 February\n\nSynopsis:\nStorming across a beautifully blustery Margate beach, we find Nelly (Felicity Jones), a haunted woman who cuts a very different figure to the same young woman who, years earlier at only 18, first encounters the talented, legendary, and older, Charles Dickens (Ralph Fiennes).\nTrapped in a lifeless marriage and the isolation of his fame, Dickens tenderly pursues the young actress who, despite disapproving of relations outside of wedlock, finds herself succumbing to her literary idol\u2019s advances. \nA story of guilt, shame and secrecy, their relationship has its own trials before Nelly is forced to live an invisible life with Dickens until his death separates them. But while he lives on through the words of his fans and in the books on her shelves, will she ever be able to forget him? \n\nPsychologies Film Club questions to discuss:\n\n\u2022\tDo you think Charles Dickens took advantage of Nelly's position, or did he truly love her?\n\n\u2022\tIn later life, Nelly is still consumed by her past relationship. What past events still haunt you now?\n\n\u2022\tNelly lead an invisible life for the sake of her relationship. Would you do the same in the name of love?\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

I worry I am running from something and that I'll never find a suitable career.'\n\nLucy replies: 'It sounds like you want and deserve some relaxation and a chance to explore other sides of you. But often our gut feeling about a situation can be revealing. Maybe what you are running from is other peoples expectations of you, or the idea of 'settling down'. Or maybe you are using the implied criticism of running away as an obstacle to pastures new? Ask yourself truthfully about your career and what you mean by 'suitable'. \n\nKnowing ourselves is a lifelong process, so I'd say the more experiences we can have to find out who we are, the better.'\n\nFor more Dilemmas, pick up the February issue or see our online archive by searching 'Dilemmas' in our homepage search engine at www.psychologies.co.uk Psychologies",
