Official description/explantion was as follows:\n\n\"In this video, wooden balls roll up the slopes just as if they are pulled by a magnet. The behavior of the balls seems impossible, because it is against the gravity. The video is not a computer graphic, but a real scene. What is actually happening is that the orientations of the slopes are perceived oppositely, and hence the descending motion is misinterpreted as ascending motion. This illusion is remarkable in that it is generated by a three-dimensional solid object and physical motion, instead of a two-dimensional picture.\"\n\nThere is a page dedicated to optical illusions over at the main website.

The tune that does it for me everytime is Bizzare Love Triangle by New Order (http://youtu.be/W2Ii0K77K1k). \n\nThe eighties was my decade and this anthem transports me straight back there everytime, in fact I've got Frissons right now just thinking about it. \n\nSo What Does it For You? What's your Frisson number one? Post your answer here. I'm sure Yale will be very interested in the results. \n\n(Photo Credit: Marylane) Timeline Photos",

          "Following on from my last post, a very warm welcome to http://www.all-about-body-language.com/. I had originally planned just to have a body language section on my psychology website but such is the scope and range of this fascinating topic it soon became clear that it needed a dedicated website to do justice to all the things we intend to cover. I say we because I am extremely fortunate to be developing the website in collaboration with Craig-James Baxter.\n\nCraig is a master trainer in reading advanced micro expressions and is one of the most viewed body language decoders in YouTube\u2019s history, having complied nearly 100 body language analysis videos featuring celebrities, politicians, musicians and high profile criminology cases.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about body language the site already has plenty of information and resources available: Including:\n\nBody language analysis videos\nBody language guides\nBody language tips\nBody language Q & A\nBody language articles\n\nAnd that's just the beginning, we've got some amazing things lined-up, such as exclusive interviews with some of the leading body language experts in the world.\n\nI really hope you enjoy exploring our new website.\n\nPlease help us get the word out by liking and sharing this post.\n\nAs always, many thanks for your support.\n\nDavid\n\nhttp://www.all-about-body-language.com/ Timeline Photos",

Nothing too formal, the successful student(s) will be involved with the psychology facebook page - moderating/commenting etc and I'd like to do more with the free classic article initiative (http://bit.ly/FreePsychClassics) so there might be opportunities to help out there as well.\n\nThis is very much a part-time, help out as and when you can position, and although it would be unpaid, it will hopefully prove to be an enjoyable experience worthy of inclusion on a resume.\n\nIf this sounds like something you might be interested in and you're currently studying psychology just let me know and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. You can either PM me via this page or e-mail me --> david@all-about-psychology.com\n\nCheers,\n\nDavid Timeline Photos",

Psychological research has revealed the dangers of relying on evidence gained from an eyewitness and also how careful the police need to be when questioning witnesses.\n\nUsing videos of real witnesses and from cameras that go behind the scenes of a police investigation, this course explores the psychology of eyewitness testimony. You will get the chance to test your own cognitive skills and to see whether your powers of investigation are as good as a crack squad of police officers, as you try to solve a crime using nothing but evidence from eyewitnesses.\n\nThe course started on 9th June but learners can enrol at any time.
