The behavior of the balls seems impossible, because it is against the gravity. The video is not a computer graphic, but a real scene. What is actually happening is that the orientations of the slopes are perceived oppositely, and hence the descending motion is misinterpreted as ascending motion.

Additionally, Yale's position in the nightclub industry gives him access to a vast quantity of unique data, which has already led to some remarkable conclusions.\n\nFor more information on this fascinating research, check out Yale Fox's blog on the science of nightlife - http://www.darwinvsthemachine.com/\n\nThis is the latest video added to the \"TED Videos\" playlist on the Psychology YouTube channel.\n\nYou can access all the videos on the Psychology YouTube channel via the following link. \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/LearnAboutPsychology.

Watson and Rosalie Rayner is one of the most influential, infamous and iconic research articles ever published in the history of psychology. Commonly referred to as \"The Case of Little Albert\" this psychology classic attempted to show how fear could be induced in an infant through classical conditioning. \r\n\r\nBonus Material:\r\n\r\nOne of the most dramatic aspects of Watson and Rayner's original study was that they had planned to test a number of methods by which they could remove Little Albert's conditioned fear responses. However, as Watson noted \"Unfortunately Albert was taken from the hospital the day the above tests were made. Hence the opportunity of building up an experimental technique by means of which we could remove the conditioned emotional responses was denied us.\"\r\n\r\nThis unforeseen turn of events was something that obviously stayed with Watson, as under his guidance some three years later, Mary Cover Jones conducted a follow-up study - A Laboratory Study of Fear: The Case of Peter - which illustrated how fear may be removed under laboratory conditions. This additional and highly relevant article is also presented in full.  \r\n\r\nIf you live outside the USA/UK, just go the Amazon website in your country and type the book title into the search box.\r\n\r\nNo kindle?

Watson and Rosalie Rayner is one of the most influential, infamous and iconic research articles ever published in the history of psychology. Commonly referred to as \"The Case of Little Albert\" this psychology classic attempted to show how fear could be induced in an infant through classical conditioning. \r\n\r\nBonus Material:\r\n\r\nOne of the most dramatic aspects of Watson and Rayner's original study was that they had planned to test a number of methods by which they could remove Little Albert's conditioned fear responses. However, as Watson noted \"Unfortunately Albert was taken from the hospital the day the above tests were made. Hence the opportunity of building up an experimental technique by means of which we could remove the conditioned emotional responses was denied us.\"\r\n\r\nThis unforeseen turn of events was something that obviously stayed with Watson, as under his guidance some three years later, Mary Cover Jones conducted a follow-up study - A Laboratory Study of Fear: The Case of Peter - which illustrated how fear may be removed under laboratory conditions. This additional and highly relevant article is also presented in full. \r\n\r\nIf you live outside the USA/UK, just go the Amazon website in your country and type the book title into the search box.\r\n\r\nNo kindle?

How did they cope with the realization that the only thing destroyed on the 21st of December 2012 was their strongly held belief. \r\n\r\nEnter Cognitive Dissonance - a robust psychological mechanism which helps resolve states of inner tension triggered by logically inconsistent ways of thinking.\r\n\r\nAnd as far as inconsistent thinking goes; thinking that the world is definitely going to end on a certain day, only for it to not, is about as inconsistent as it gets. The brilliant psychologist Leon Festinger was acutely aware of this back in 1956 when he infiltrated a group who believed that the world was about to end but that the members of the group would be rescued by a flying saucer.\r\n\r\nWhen the prophecy failed, this was explained by the group leader as being down to the fact that the group had \"spread so much light\" that God had spared the planet. The group then set about spreading the good news to non-believers. Now that's classic Cognitive Dissonance!\r\n\r\nPlease like and share to help celebrate Cognitive Dissonance day. :-) Timeline Photos.",

How will they be coping this morning with the realization that the only thing destroyed on the 21st of December was their strongly held belief. \r\n\r\nEnter Cognitive Dissonance - a robust psychological mechanism which helps resolve states of inner tension triggered by logically inconsistent ways of thinking.\r\n\r\nAnd as far as inconsistent thinking goes; thinking that the world is definitely going to end on a certain day, only for it to not, is about as inconsistent as it gets. The brilliant psychologist Leon Festinger was acutely aware of this back in 1956 when he infiltrated a group who believed that the world was about to end but that the members of the group would be rescued by a flying saucer.\r\n\r\nWhen the prophecy failed, this was explained by the group leader as being down to the fact that the group had \"spread so much light\" that God had spared the planet. The group then set about spreading the good news to non-believers. Now that's classic Cognitive Dissonance!\r\n\r\nPlease like and share to help celebrate Cognitive Dissonance day. Timeline Photos.",

Their goal was to bring together experts on serial murder in order to identify commonalities of knowledge.\n\nOne of the issues addressed during this unique symposium was the fact that the rarity of serial murder combined with inaccurate, anecdotal and fictional portrayals of serial killers has resulted in a number of common misconceptions arising. As a result of their deliberations, the expert panel identified 7 main serial killer myths, the details of which can be accessed via the following link.\n\nhttp://www.all-about-forensic-psychology.com/serial-killers.html.
